_________________________________________________________

You've probably noticed these 'stats' flying around everywhere:
Level (L)         - A numerical measure of a Pokemon's strength, from 1 to 100.
Experience (Exp.) - Defeat foes to gain experience and increase your stats.
HP                - The Pokemon's health. Reduce this to zero to faint it.
Attack (Atk)      - How much damage can be dealt with physical* type attacks.
Defense (Def)     - Reduces damage recieved from physical* type attacks.
Special (Spc)     - Deals AND reduces damage to special^ type attacks.
Speed (Spe)       - The Pokemon with the highest Speed acts first in a round.

In addition, each of your Pokemon's moves has PP, which determines how many
times that move can be used. Once it gets to zero, that move cannot be used
until you restore its PP (which can be done by visiting a Poke Center or using
an item such as an Ether). If all a Pokemon's moves have zero PP, then it uses
the move Struggle which also damages the user. Because the AI is a cheating
b****** (buffoon), AI foes have infinite PP.

*Physical types: Bug, Fighting, Flying, Ghost, Ground, Normal, Poison, Rock.
^Special types:  Dragon, Electric, Fire, Grass, Ice, Psychic, Water.

Your rival will always pick the Pokemon with the type advantage over yours.
If you pick Bulbasaur, he gets Charmander. Your Charmander bags him a Squirtle,
and Squirtle is opposed by Bulbasaur. Tough luck, I'm afraid.

Not much we can do here, really. Use the FIGHT command to hammer away with your
only attacking option (Scratch, Tackle or ThunderShock) and hope your rival
bites the dust before you do. Hopefully, he'll stall with stat-lowering moves,
but don't hope for too many or they can eventually be harmful.

Use the ITEM command to use that Potion from your PC if things get tricky,
which will fully heal your battler as they have such low HP at the moment.
Yellow players might be able to paralyse (PAR) Eevee (a 10% chance) which will
be immensely helpful if Eevee then goes fully paralysed, which happens with a
25% chance each time he spends a turn in PAR. If he does go fully paralysed, he
forfeits a turn! But don't count on it too much.
___

You don't need to win, I should mention, but I'd recommend you do because
you'll get enough Exp. to get your starter Pokemon to L6 and some cash to boot.
By the way, this is the only time in the game where your Pokemon will be fully
healed after a battle, and one of only two opportunities where you can lose a
battle without forfeiting half your money.

In Yellow, you can influence how your rival's Eevee evolves.

In section headers for areas with wild Pokemon, you'll notice an Encounter Rate
value--this is how many times out of 256 steps, on average, you can expect a
random encounter with Pokemon in the grass. Basically, higher number = more
random encounters. So here in Route 1, you'd expect a random enocunter every
25/256 steps--that's about a 9.8% chance per step, or about 1 in every 10
steps. Fun!

Hmmm... Pokemon? Unfortunately, you can't catch them yet. Just bash them up for
easy Exp. and make sure to use the RUN command when your Pokemon starts getting
low on health. There's a Poke Center in the next city which heals Pokemon to
full. For free. So hold your horses.

Talk to the first person you see for another <POTION>, then check it off on the
checklist. Get your starter to L7 on the way, for there is another Rival battle
coming up soon. Pikachu's ThunderShock is super-effective against Pidgeys, so
use that to your advantage. Otherwise, just attack with whatever you have. Just
keep heading north to arrive in...

[ ] Oak's Parcel

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 7

The first thing you'll want to do is head to the Pokemon Center to heal up your
Pokemon. Most cities have Poke Centers and some out-of-the-way places have them
too. They'll heal your team for free so you can never use one too much. It's
the first building you'll come across. Speak to the nurse behind the counter
directly in front of you to use it.

Poke Centers are also home to PCs, which, in this bizarre world, act as a bank
account to access, withdraw and deposit Pokemon and Items. To the far right of
the Poke Center, fire up the PC to store junky Pokemon and Items which are
taking up valuable space in your inventory. You can only have six Pokemon in a
team, so plonk the rest in the PC where they will end up sitting for the rest
of their mundane lives. Use SOMEONE'S PC to access Pokemon withdrawals and
deposits.

Pokemon in the PC are organised into 12 different boxes, each of which can
store up to 20 Pokemon. You must manually set which box you are currently using
to withdraw and deposit with the CHANGE BOX option. If you have a full team of
six Pokemon and catch another in the wild, it will be sent to the box you have
selected. If that box is full of 20 Pokemon, you will not be able to catch any
more until you access the PC and manually change box. I'll remind you later on
to change box when it's feasable that you might be approaching the 20 Pokemon
per box limit, but after the first time it's up to you to remember.

In a similar standard, your backpack will only hold 20 different types of item
(regardless of size or weight; apparently a Bicycle takes up the same amount of
space as a Nugget), by which I mean that 99 of the same item require one item
slot. Dump your unused items in the PC too, although be aware that it too has a
limit, this time of 50 items (no boxes to mess around with, thank goodness).
Use YOUR PC for Item management.

Anyway, back to the main quest. Once you're done in the Poke Center, head to
the Poke Mart which is to the right and a bit north of the Poke Center. Go
inside and the attendant will hand you <OAK'S PARCEL> that needs to go to him
in Pallet Town. Yawn. Time to head back to there then, I guess.

Cut through Route 1 and just go south. You can jump the ledges to avoid the
grass, if you wish, but there's the small patch at the end you'll have to pass
through. Personally, I head through the grass for the invaluable Exp.

[ ] Town Map

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 8

Head to Oak's Lab and hand him the parcel. Your Rival will arrive and mouth off
a bit, as usual. After all the chit-chat you receive a Pokedex, a handy tool
that records data on all the critters you've seen, with extra info on those
you've caught. This is the secondary quest in the Pokemon series--to fill up
the Dex.

Once you've nabbed the Pokedex, head to your Rival's house, the one directly
above the lab. Yes, like most RPGs, people in this world don't mind if you
barge into their homes and steal everything that isn't nailed down while
they're going about their business. But anyway, speak to your Rival's sister to
grab that <TOWN MAP> he was boasting about so much. It's mildly useful if you
don't know the layout of the world, but you won't need it with this guide and
becomes obsolete upon gaining HM02 (Fly).

At this point I bet you're itching to get some more Pokemon, so I've got good
news for you. Head back to Viridian City for me, would you? On your way through
Route 1, aim for L8 with your Pokemon.

The first thing you'll want to do now is head to the Poke Mart and buy some
Poke Balls. You can never have too many, but I'd suggest around 10 or so for
now, which should still leave you with $1175, a comfortable amount--$1000 if
you lost to your Rival (!). You might also want an Antidote or two for Viridian
Forest--especially Red players--but I never bother, because them pesky Weedles
always die before they can hurt you if you know how to fight them.

Status Effects
--------------
Speaking of Antidotes, you might have run into some status effects already,
namely if you're a Yellow player and have managed to paralyse any foes. Status
effects can cripple your team members if you aren't careful. Here's what you're
up against:

Burn (BRN)         - Saps HP and halves your Attack stat.
Confusion          - Pokemon attacks itself 50% of the time. Eventually wears
                     off. Can switch out to get rid of the effect.
Flinch             - Miss a turn.
Freeze (FRZ)       - Afflicted Pokemon cannot use any moves.
Leech Seed         - Saps HP and transfers it to the foe. Can switch out to get
                     rid of the effect.
Paralysis (PAR)    - Quarters your Speed stat and occasionally miss a turn.
Poison (PSN)       - Saps HP in battles *and* saps HP slowly while walking
                     around!
Sleep (SLP)        - Afflicted Pokemon cannot use any moves. Eventually wears
                     off.
Toxic Poison (PSN) - Saps HP in battles; effect worsens over time. Reverts to
                     standard Poison upon switching out or finishing battle.

Always be sure to keep a couple of healing items on you, which can be bought
from Poke Marts--Burn Heal for Burns, Ice Heal for Freeze, Parlyz Heal for
Paralysis, Antidote for Poison and Awakening for Sleep.

Full Heal also cures everything with abbreviations--Burn, Freeze, Paralysis,
Poison and Sleep. Only one of these status effects can be applied to a Pokemon
at any one time. The others--Confusion, Flinch and Leech Seed, can all be
applied on top of any one of those status effects.

Check out section M03; 'Status Effects' for some more in-depth details.

Anyway, there's another fight against Rival-boy in a while, which you might
want to get into practice for because you are probably not ready for him yet
with your L8 or so monster. So what do we do? Well, we use these new Poke
Balls, of course. Head back to Route 1, first of all.

[ ] Pidgey  [ ] Rattata

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 8

Get yourself into a wild battle like usual. Then prepare to catch something!
Catching Pokemon essentially requires you to lower their health as low as you
can (below a third is the best you can get--any farther is unnecessary) without
killing them, then tossing Balls at them until they're caught. Easy, no? Status
ailments such as paralysis improve your chances, so if your Pikachu is L8 in
Yellow, Thunder Wave will help out as well, but don't sweat it too much since
the difference is negligible on Pokemon as easy to catch as this.

Here's what's up for grabs:

<PIDGEY> - Rating: **
A weak Flying type with no decent Flying moves until you hit Cerulean City and
get the Fly HM (more on HMs later). You might want it now, but it will soon
lose its usefulness. Don't bother with it, but catch it for the Pokedex, or to
Fly you around later in the game.

<RATTATA> - Rating: ***
Actually really useful in the early game and learns the fantastic Hyper Fang at
L14, far and away the best move at this point. Like Pidgey, though, it loses
usefulness as the game progresses. Get a nice variety of TMs but weak stats
overall.

Now that you have more than one Pokemon in your party, you can use the PKMN
command in battle to switch Pokemon if things get hairy. You can also use the
POKEMON command in the start menu to switch Pokemon about. The topmost one in
your group of up to six will be sent out first, with the other five as back-
ups. Once you've caught the two critters here, head back to Viridian.

Well now, we're preparing for Rival battle numero 2 at this point. I would
highly recommend going to Viridian Forest first to catch a wider variety of
critters, so that's where I'm taking us now.

On your way out of Viridian City to the north, Coffee Man will bug you and give
you a (rubbish) tutorial on catching Pokemon. Grin and bear it, I'm afraid--I
think my tutorial was much better! Afterwards, examine the nearby tree to the
left (looks like a cactus) for a hidden <POTION>. (Note: Hidden items will be
denoted with an '(H)' symbol next to them in the item checklist.) Then head
north to Route 2.

[ ] Caterpie (B)  [ ] Weedle (R)  [ ] Nidoran F (Y)  [ ] Nidoran M (Y)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 8

Okay, let's start catching stuff.

<CATERPIE> - Rating: **
Only available in Blue for the moment but available in just a minute in Red and
Yellow. Caterpie evolves early at L7 and then again at L10 into Butterfree, who
will help immensely in the next gym if you don't have Bulbasaur or Squirtle. If
you don't have one of these two, definitely get one. You might want one anyway,
since although its stats are sucky, it learns Sleep Powder super-early and a
few useful moves before it gets outclassed. It's definitely the best Pokemon
you can have at this point once it evolves, but it is severely outclassed later
on and so gets a lowish rating overall.

<WEEDLE> - Rating: *
Available in Blue soon enough, but not Yellow. Unlike Caterpie, Weedle and his
evolutions are useless.

<NIDORAN F> - Rating: *****
<NIDORAN M> - Rating: *****
More or less the same Pokemon--if you invest some TMs in these guys and their
evolutions, the final form, Nidoqueen or Nidoking, can be a beast. In Yellow it
learns Double Kick at L12, which is a decent move against the next Gym. You can
also have it evolved into its final form by Mt. Moon, which is halfway between
the first and second Gyms. Power output is pretty good, stats are nice across
the board, wide movepool with TM support... Very nice.

Basically, pick up a Caterpie--especially if you have Charmander or Pikachu as
a starter. Nidoran F/M is an incredible Pokemon if you don't mind giving it
some TMs.

You might as well get your starter to L9 whilst you're searching for those
pesky Pokemon. If you're having trouble finding a particular Pokemon, save and
reset. It will reset the Random Number Generator and hopefully give you a
better chance of finding what you want.

We're basically just passing through Route 2 to get to Viridian Forest in the
north:

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 9

Note: In the new Pokemon list, I'll be listing evolved Pokemon with round
brackets '(' and ')' as a way of denoting that you don't need to catch them.
Metapod, for example, is not necessary to catch, as you could just evolve
Caterpie instead. Likewise, you can evolve Pidgey into Pidgeotto, so Pidgeotto
gets round brackets. You don't need to catch these guys if you're willing to
train up their pre-evolutions.

Welcome to Viridian Forest. I wouldn't advise talking to anyone except the
first person you see, or even walking into their line of sight. These guys are
trainers and will challenge you to an inescapable fight. Although you would
probably win, this isn't why we're here at the moment.

The reason we're here is to expand our Pokedex and team.

<PIKACHU (RB)> - Rating: ***
He's the only one I'll evaluate here, since the other Pokemon you can catch
have been evaluated before or are just evolutions. Pikachu is a speedy Electric
type and well worth your time, though he won't be much help in the next Gym. It
evolves in Red and Blue, so can become quite powerful with the right TMs. It
really helps out against Water types, especially if you lack a Grass type. I
grabbed one.

Red/Blue players will want a Pikachu, Yellow players and those with Charmander
will want Caterpie so that you can get a Butterfree for the next gym (you could
catch Metapod to evolve too, but it has no attacking moves). Everything else is
filler.

Your starter should reach about L10 at this point, which is good. Once you've
caught whatever you want, head back out the way you came. Just go south into
Viridian City, heal up and then take the west exit to Route 22.

A much more worthy Flying type than Pidgey and will really help out in Viridian

team instead of a Fire type, since both types can nail Grass and Bug types, and
has nice Attack and Speed stats.

<MANKEY (Y)> - Rating: ***
The other option for Yellow players is Mankey, a decent Fighting type Pokemon.
His Low Kick is something to consider as a Fighting move against the next gym
and Normal types such as your Rival's Eevee. He's good for this very early
portion of the game, but, like Butterfree, will become less useful over time
(although Mankey will always remain somewhat useful--Butterfree very quickly
approaches vast realms of suck). Get one if you're dying for a super-effective
attack against Eevee and Rattata.

Red and Blue players might want a spare Nidoran M to trade later on for the
counterpart female version. The trade is useless really, but necessary for a
perfect game file if you're into that kinda thing. You must ALSO get an extra
Spearow to trade for a Farfetch'd as well. Yellow players don't have to do
anything. Neato.

Now that you've got everything you might want, it's time to gear up for a
battle against your Rival. You should be around Level 9 with two or three
Pokemon right about now, I would suggest.

My Team

I'll be updating you periodically of my progress during my playthrough while
writing this walkthrough, just so you have an idea of levels and type
diversity. This team is nowhere near the best team in the game, but it's fairly
solid at any rate. However, I'd check out section 'L02; 'In-Game (Elite Four)
Teams' for better teammate recommendations--like I said earlier, you can search
for individual Pokemon by using Ctrl+ F and searching for their name in angled
brackets.

Pikachu     L 9 ~ ThunderShock, Growl, Tail Whip, Thunder Wave
Metapod     L 8 ~ Tackle, String Shot, Harden
Spearow     L 7 ~ Peck, Growl

Actually, I'm probably a bit under-levelled here but I got through okay. I'd
say a good team at this point would consist of your starter, a Spearow if you
don't have Charmander, or a Caterpie/Metapod/Butterfree if you do. Grab a
Caterpie if you have Pikachu as a starter, and grab a Pikachu if you are
playing Red or Blue. My Yellow team is outlined above. A Butterfree can be
really handy this early on in the game and will remain useful for a little
while with its status inducing moves.
___

Okay, your Rival is waiting to be beaten in another battle that doesn't need to
be won. Proceed north out of the grass to trigger the battle. Note that the
first Pokemon at the top of a trainer's list--for example below--will always be
sent out first, so plan accordingly ;).

Pidgey and Spearow can both eat a ThunderShock from 'Chu, so send him out
first. Squirtle also bites the dust to ThunderShock, so if that's the case you
have an easy victory. Bulbasaur will croak it to Spearow's Peck. Now the
problem Pokemon remain...

Eevee will fall to a Low Kick from Mankey, but if you don't have one you might
just have to bash it up the old-fashioned way. Same with Charmander, who can't
be harmed super-effectively yet, although he has no Fire moves so you're okay
to send Bulbasaur in. Just mash away and you should emerge victorious.
___

I admit that this battle is a bit unfair and that you'll probably have to grind
on wild Pokemon a bit to win. If you seem to lose too easily, gain some more
levels. Again, in Yellow you can influence how your rival's Eevee evolves!

I hate Viridian Forest. Ugh. Well, we'd best get on with it. First, check the

Spearow's Peck or Charmander's Ember will fry these guys. Watch out for Poison
Sting from Weedle in Red and Blue, and if you do get Poisoned then use one of

if you have it, but be careful as Poison Sting will be super-effective against
your Bug types.

Confusion from Butterfree, if you have it, will hammer these Poison types. Just

After the trainer, head north through the left pathway, past the sign and not
through the grass. An item ball at the end contains either an <ANTIDOTE> for

possible before heading up this grassy path.

The guy ahead is the last trainer in the Forest. Woo! Before you engage in
battle, check the square of floor he's looking at for a hidden <POTION>. Again,

[ ] TM34 (Bide)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 12

At the top of the city is the Pewter Museum of Science which costs $50 to check
out and is utterly worthless. You get to see two skeletons. If you want to see
and you're tight, you can save before you go in, look around and then reset for
free admission!

The person on the right of the map won't let you progress until you have the
coveted BoulderBadge, so let's go get it. I had three Pokemon at L11-12 at this
point. This is fine in Yellow, but a bit low to be facing Brock with in Red and
Blue since his levels are slightly higher. Some training in Route 2/Viridian
Forest probably wouldn't hurt us now, would it? In Red and Blue, I would aim
for similar levels to Brock--L12-14. At least get Bulbasaur to learn Vine Whip
(L13) or Squirtle to learn Bubble (L8).
___

My Team

Pikachu     L12 ~ ThunderShock, Growl, Thunder Wave, Quick Attack
Butterfree  L11 ~ Tackle, String Shot, Harden, Confusion
Spearow     L11 ~ Peck, Growl, Leer

In Red/Blue, Butterfree will help since you can use its sleep-inducing move
that it learns pretty soon to help bag yourself an Abra (one of the most
overpowered Pokemon in the game) in just a little while. Psychic coverage
doesn't hurt either, once it learns Confusion.
___

Well, we might as well get started. Stock up on Potions if you want, but you
shouldn't need too many more than what you've picked up so far--especially if
you've nabbed the hidden ones--then head on over to the Gym. It's on the left
side of the map; you have to go north past it and loop around its left side to
get to the entrance.

Pewter City's Gym Leader, Brock, specialises in Rock types. You can skip the
first trainer, but you might as well fight him for the experience.

I thought this was supposed to be a Rock type Gym? Well, whatever. Vine Whip
with Bulbasaur, Bubble with Squirtle (or Water Gun if you have it) and
Confusion with Butterfree. Job done. In Red and Blue, be careful of repeated
Sand-Attacks which will make Sandshrew almost impossible to hit. If this
happens, switch out to a different Pokemon and the accuracy modifiers will be
reset.

Okay, well it's time for the big guy himself. Save, then speak to the Pewter

_________________________________________________________

Brock must've cheated to get Bind, as Onix doesn't learn it naturally until
level 15! Or maybe he bred it over in Gold/Silver/Crystal, but whatever, it's
strategy time. Both his Pokemon are quadruple weak to Grass and Water attacks,
so if you have Bulbasaur or Squirtle you're laughing, really.

If you have Charmander or Pikachu, then your best bet is Butterfree. Confusion
isn't super-effective but it will absolutely destroy them both because of their
ridiculously low Special stats. Although it isn't very effective, Charmander's
Ember will do decent damage for the same reason. Pikcahu's Electric attacks
won't damage either of Brock's Pokemon at all and they will take minimal damage
from its Normal attacks, so just avoid using Pikachu for this fight.

Geodude is a piece of cake this way, but Onix is a bit tougher. Higher levelled
and with better moves, it's a bit of a pain. Bind is a move which traps you and
damages continually, and it will have you tearing your hair out, so just switch
if he uses this move or ride it out until it finishes (In RBY, trapping moves
stop you from attacking. In later games, they stop you from switching, so you
CAN switch out in RBY).

He will also use Bide, a move which stores up damage for 2-3 turns and then
unleashes double the damage the Pokemon received back at the opponent. If you
don't think you can waste Onix in two turns after he uses it, stall him out
with non-damaging moves like Growl or Harden. Then when Bide is over, resume
pounding on him.

Basically, exploiting their weaknesses and low Special stats will net you the
win. Also, Brock will use Potions when their health gets low. Solution--drop
them in one hit! Either that, or just ride it out. You'll be fine.
___

After the battle, you receive the BoulderBadge, which increases the Attack stat
of all Pokemon in in-game battles to 9/8ths of its original value. Awesome.

You also get <TM34> (Bide) and the ability to use Flash outside of battle. Oh,
and money. Bide isn't worth teaching and, if you plan on exploiting the
Missingno. Glitch, isn't worth using because once you do, it's gone forever.
Oh, and by the way, the Missingno. glitch allows you to clone an item.
Indefinitely. Good stuff. Only for Red and Blue though.

TM34 is unique, so don't use it up or it'll be gone forever. Save it for the
Missingno. (item duplication) glitch later on, if you want. In fact, most TMs
are like this. Assume all TMs are one-of-a-kind unless I say otherwise.

Now leave the gym, heal up etc. and make sure to buy plenty of Poke Balls (say
10) because we'll be going through some lengthy caves soon with plenty of new
Pokemon in. Couldn't hurt to top up with a handful of Potions and maybe an
Escape Rope or two if you can spare the money. Unfortunately we cannot buy
Repels yet... Time to head to Route 3 which is the east exit out of Pewter
City.

it.
___

And that's that. Phew! Time to be catching some Pokemon, methinks.

<SANDSHREW> - Rating: ****
Yellow players can grab themselves a Sandshrew, a Ground type that can be very
powerful if you invest some later TMs into it. It learns the horrendously
overpowered Slash at L17, and even gets a very powerful--100 power!--STAB TM in
Dig, making him ridiculously fearsome, but he doesn't do very well against
Special Pokemon and has below average Speed.

<JIGGLYPUFF> - Rating: *
In Red and Blue, you'll instead nab a Jigglypuff, though Blue Players can grab
a Sandshrew shortly. Jiggly is a Sleep inducer which is always nice, but it
only has Sing which has a mere 55% accuracy. Butterfree has Sleep Powder coming
up soon--L17 in Red and Blue and L15 in Yellow--and Sleep Powder is 75%
accurate so it's much better. Jigglypuff can learn quite a few good TMs but
there isn't much reason to give it them, due to its low stats.

Get them for the Pokedex at least, then continue on and head north into the
west section of Route 4.
_______

Route 4
_______

New Pokemon
-----------
[ ] Magikarp

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 14

Since we can't get any Pokemon here yet, really, I'll handle the data thingies
once we get out of Mt. Moon. All we really need to know is that there is a Poke
Center here, which should be used and the entrance to Mt. Moon, which will also
be used.

Inside the Poke Center is a man who will sell you a Magikarp for $500. It's
pretty cheap if you're dying to get one now--but there are loads available
later for the cost of a Poke Ball.

<MAGIKARP> - Rating: ***
Magikarp and his evolution don't learn any natural Water moves until late in
the game, so you'll have to stick to TMs. I'd say don't bother yet, though if
you badly need a Gyarados (L20, slow to evolve) then by all means go ahead.
Gyarados itself is very cool, just a bit of a liability right now. I'll remind
you to get one later if you don't want to buy it now. It does have fantastic
stats and learns a great set of TMs, though.

Take the nearby cave entrance at the east to enter the dangerous Mt. Moon. Hope
you stocked up on healing items and Poke Balls like I suggested! A good team at
this point would consist of about three Pokemon at L13-14.

-----------
[ ] Clefairy  [ ] Zubat  [ ] Paras  [ ] Geodude

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 14

Start catching stuff as soon as you enter if you want, but note that the rarer
creatures will start appearing with greater frequency on the lower floors,
especially Clefairy. When engaging them, make good use of Thunder Wave from
Pikachu (be aware that it doesn't work on Geodude) and Stun
Spore/PoisonPowder/Sleep Powder from Butterfree to make your prey easier to
capture. Sleep Powder is best, if you have it.

<ZUBAT> - Rating: *
You won't be able to avoid catching a Zubat. You'll soon get tired of seeing
this little sucker (heh, sucker, get it?) because it pops up bloody everywhere.
It is awful in combat so just catch it for the Pokedex. When fighting it, watch
out for confusion from Supersonic--just run if it happens. Zubat is a terrible
Pokemon with terrible typing, terrible moves and average stats. Meh. I'd avoid
it.

<GEODUDE> - Rating: ** (Graveler)
          - Rating: *** (Golem)
Geodude is also relatively common here. This is your answer to Normal types if
you have had trouble with them thus far. Geodude and his evolutions are good
because they are Rock/Ground types and hence resist Normal moves. They have
great Attack stats, even better Defense and learn some pretty good moves
naturally (looking at you, Earthquake!). Unfortunately, they have a 4x weakness
to Grass and Water and are hideously slow. They also cannot evolve without
being traded. For now, however, he's a decent choice and you can decide later
on whether to keep him or not.

<CLEFAIRY> - Rating: ***
The other two are much rarer game, but if you happen to bump into Clefairy now
then by all means grab it. Clefairy's stats are sub-par and its level up
movepool is abysmal, so I'd skip it. It also learns a bunch of useful TMs and
HM's... which we don't have yet. Yellow players should catch an extra Clefairy
to trade for a Mr. Mime later on.

<PARAS> - Rating: *
The other semi-rare one is Paras. It has the only access to Spore--a 100% sleep
move--in the entire game. Unfortunately, Spore comes at L27 or L30 if you
evolve it and it just has no other moves that are really that good. 4x Fire,
Poison and Flying weaknesses don't help an already lost cause. Give it a miss
and use something better with Sleep Powder instead.

Well I hope you're ready for Mt. Moon. You have 12 fairly tough trainers to
defeat, but the real challenge is staying sane in the face of so many Zubat. I
really wish Pewter sold Repels.

I'd highly recommend getting a Geodude when you enter. Take it to the Poke
Center, heal it and slot it in your team somewhere. It'll be worth it. Get him
to L16 ASAP to learn Rock Throw. This will waste Bug, Fire, Flying and Ice
types nicely.

Head a bit north from the entrance. When the cave opens up, go west and then
south and grab the item ball with <TM12> (Water Gun) in. This TM is fairly
useless soon enough so you might as well use it. It can help your team deal
with the Geodudes here. Squirtle can learn it as well, but he will at L15
anyway so why bother? Don't use it up if you're saving all unique items for
duplication later on.

If you have a starter and wish to evolve it (not evolving it will make it learn
moves faster, see my Pokedex for full details), get it to L16 now, which should
be possible. Unfortunately, this doesn't apply to Pikachu. In Yellow, he will
never evolve :(.

Head north and west to find another item ball with a <POTION> inside, then
fight the nearby trainer.

_________________________________________________________

Hmm. Make sure it doesn't put you to sleep for five turns and Pound on your ass
like it did to me. This could be quite tough. Hit it with physical attacks such
as Tackle, Rock Throw, Peck or, ideally, Mankey's Low Kick/Nidoran's Double
Kick. Geodude won't be hurt by its attacks but is slow so will be put to sleep
pretty often. Otherwise just put it to sleep with your Butterfree and smack it
around with Confusion. All else failing, just hit it as hard as you can.
___

If she kicked your ass like she did mine, journey back to the Poke Center. Then
head north from this trainer, continuing on past her to come across a ladder.
Take it. Follow this pathway to another ladder, climb this one and then fight

Water Gun or Vine Whip on Sandshrew. If not, then Confusion from Butterfree
will have to suffice. Rattata falls to Low Kick or try using Geodude for its
handy Normal resistance. Zubat can be felled with ThunderShock, Confusion and
Rock Throw. Options much? Take that, you stupid bat. If it uses Supersonic and
connects, switch out to avoid the confusion and damaging yourself.
___

After the battle, head on up the plateau and nab the <HP UP> that sits there.
It will boost your Pokemon's HP, but it will barely be noticeable at this
stage; by 1, if you're lucky. Save it for now--I would. Head back down the
ladder and through that pathway and up the other ladder to emerge back on the
entrance floor. From the ladder, head south to encounter yet another trainer.

In the southeast corner of the room is a <RARE CANDY> item. It raises a
Pokemon's level by one. Use it now if you wish, but, obviously, the longer you
hold out for it the better, because it's harder to gain levels the higher you
are. Ideally, you use it at L99 to get to L100!

Rare Candies are finite in number, so if you don't save them all or duplicate
them later on through the Missingno. glitch, you're screwed and cannot have any
more.

Head north from this to bump into an <ESCAPE ROPE>, then keep heading north.
When you near the north wall of the cave, turn west to run into another female

_________________________________________________________

Zubat can suck on ThunderShock, Rock Throw or Confusion. Switch out if
Supersonic hits. Ekans will start Wrapping which is annoying so switch or ride
it out. Confusion is the most effective move but Butterfree will take super-
effective damage from Poison Sting so it's a toss up. Stick Sleep Powder on it
first and use an Antidote if necessary.
___

After wiping the floor with the Rocket, head up the plateau to the north for
<TM01> (Mega Punch). Candidates for this Normal move that's fairly powerful
(about twice as powerful as Quick attack) include Charmander/Charmeleon,
Squirtle/Wartortle, Pikachu, Clefairy, Jigglypuff, Mankey and Geodude. The
latter two are the best candidates because of their high Attack ratings, though
Mankey learns Karate Chop at L15 which, factoring in the Critical Hit ratio, is
more powerful.

Also, if you're TM-tight, don't worry about using up TM01 right now, as you can
buy a replacement (or multiple replacements) from Celadon Department Store
later in the game. Or use the Missingno. glitch, whatever. So yeah, use it up
by all means.

South and to the east of this plateau where you found TM01 is a strange rock
that's hiding an <ETHER>, an item that restores 10PP to any move of any
Pokemon. You can't buy them in stores, so use them only when desperate because
they are of limited stock.

Head back down the ladder and all the way back to the top floor. Use the Poke
Center if you want to, because we're pressing through this cave rapidly now. To
get there quickly, consider using an Escape Rope. After that (or if you didn't
go), continue south on this top floor again and encounter your next trainer.

___

After the battle, take the <MOON STONE> in the top left corner. Moon Stones are
finite, so save one for duplication if you're in Red and Blue.

Four Pokemon can evolve via Moon Stone and you could, theoretically, own them
all now.
Nidoran F --> Nidorina (L16) --> Nidoqueen (Moon Stone)
Nidoran M --> Nidorino (L16) --> Nidoking (Moon Stone)
Clefairy --> Clefable (Moon Stone)
Jigglypuff --> Wigglytuff (Moon Stone)
Be warned that Pokemon that evolve via Stones generally stop learning moves via
level up, so check in my Pokedex whether evolving them now is a good idea.
Probably not. If you have been training a Nidoran, evolving it now would give
you a powerful Pokemon that will unfortunately rely on TMs for good moves.

Take the nearby ladder above the Hiker and follow the pathway to another
ladder. When you emerge on the other end, go north, east, then south down some
stairs to encounter another Rocket.

_________________________________________________________

In Red/Blue, this Raticate will be the hardest thing you've faced. Geodude is
your best bet here--his high Defense and his Normal resistance will come in
very handy against Hyper Fang, which will utterly screw anything else you have
at this point. Rock Throw it as much as you can and Tackle if things get
desperate. All else you can do is Low Kick perhaps or just strong attacks. On a
side note, how do you get a L16 Raticate? L20 is when Rattata evolves...

Yellow players have an easier time just using Geodude on Rattata and doing what
they do best to Zubat.
___

Ascend the other stairs and loop around in a large squareish thing. Just
continue along this path and fend off about 50 billion wild Zubat. Red/Blue
players will eventually encounter another trainer. Yellow players get to skip
this one.

You Red/Blue players thought you could get away from that battle that Yellow

of them or electrocute/confuse the bat thing.
___

Push on past the (perhaps nonexistent) Rocket. After ascending a set of stairs,
go to the east down a thin corridor to examine the white panel at the end for a
hidden <MOON STONE>. Then head back up the stairs to battle a Super Nerd with a
fossil fetish.

_________________________________________________________

Confusion is all we have against the Poison types, otherwise your strongest
attacks will probably be rolling out from Geodude. In fact, Geodude can ace
this whole thing--just be careful of Grimer disabling Rock Throw, or running
out of PP or getting poisoned by Smog. If you do use Butterfree to confuse,
Smog will be super-effective, so be careful.
___

Use Antidotes if necessary. Afterwards, you get to pick either the <DOME
FOSSIL> or the <HELIX FOSSIL>. The former can be traded in for a Kabuto and the
latter for an Omanyte, both Water/Rock Pokemon. Check the Dex for full info.
Kabuto and his evolution are probably slightly better and about a billion times
cooler looking. You can get the other from a glitch anyway. But, that's a long
way away, so pick one, abandon the other and continue up the stairs and head
west.

For Red/Blue players, victory is in sight since there are no more trainer
battles. Just follow the linear path outta here. For Yellow players however...

Yep, that's Jessie and James from the Anime show. They don't really do anything
special in this game other than pop up and annoy you from time to time. You'll
have to be weary if you've taken a beating, since their levels are decently
high. Confusion is all the super effectiveness we have against the Poison types
at the moment and Geodude can lay the smackdown on all three of these guys as
well, since he resists their moves. Mankey doesn't do badly against Meowth,
either.
___

Now, if you hang about a bit, this floor has the highest chance of encountering
a Clefairy if you have been unfortunate enough not to come across one yet. If
you want it for the Dex (or even for your team), stick around and grab it.
Remember to grab an extra one to trade for a Mr. Mime later on in Yellow, like
I mentioned earlier. Paras is more common here too.

Okay, we're all done now, I promise. Head down the ladder and follow the little
path to another ladder to be free of Mt. Moon forever! Yes!

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 16

Your Pokemon are probably exhausted from Mt. Moon. One of mine (Pikachu) was
fainted and all the others were in poor condition too. Thankfully, no trainers
lie between you and the next Poke Center in Cerulean City. Make sure you've
done everything you want to up to this point, because once we cross to
Cerulean, there ain't no going back for a while.

Start heading east and ascend the first plateau you encounter, sniffing around
for a hidden <GREAT BALL> on its peak. The position is odd to describe, but
here goes. From the gap in the lower ledge where you can enter the plateau, go
up one tile, right one, up, left and press A to uncover it. (You could find it
in other ways, but I did it this way because I find it difficult to turn on the
spot in this game).

Jump the ledges east and ascend another plateau. Keep ascending and on the
second level is an item ball in plain sight containing <TM04> (Whirlwind). This
is a fairly useless move which scares off wild Pokemon. Great... It too is
unique, so don't sell or use TM04 if you want a perfect treasure list. Save it
for duplication, or something.

After getting the two items, we can root around in the grass to the south for
some new Pokemon. Once you jump over this ledge into the grass you ain't going
back to Pallet/Viridian/Petwer for a while, bub. I would recommend visiting
Cerulean first or, more specifically, Cerulean Poke Center. Once you have done
so, get over here and catch yourself some new Pokemon for Red and Blue. Yellow
owners will find nothing new here.

I've already had a look at Sandshrew, but Blue players now have their first
opportunity to nab one. Again, he's a powerful Pokemon who has access to the
awesome STAB Dig TM very soon.

<EKANS> - Rating: *
Ekans is only available in Red, but it's near useless with mediocre stats and
poor typing in Poison. Honestly, just catch it for Pokedex fodder and nothing
else.

When you're done here, head east into Cerulean City.

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 16

If you're wondering where you can fish, strangely enough, you can fish for and
catch Pokemon in Cerulean Gym. First attraction for Yellow players is the
potential addition of Bulbasaur to the team--In the house to the left of the
Poke Center, talk to the girl at the back and she'll hand over a L10 Bulbasaur!
Sweet! If she refuses, it's because Pikachu isn't happy enough. For a quick
fix, try ramming Potions down Pikachu's throat when it's at full health--the
game will say it has no effect, but it will skyrocket Pikachu's happiness. And
you don't even lose the Potions. Do this until the little brat is satisfied and
forks over the Bulbasaur.

<BULBASAUR (Y)> - Rating: ***
A solid grass type at this point in the game, but Bellsprout mostly outclasses
it with early access to Sleep Powder and better offenses, as well as being
available at a higher level.

You might want to take Bulbasaur out for a little Route 4 training session if
you're considering adding it to your team, though the abundance of Spearow will
be off-putting. Do the bait-and-switch technique--switching out a Pokemon so
that it gains half the Exp. when the opponent is defeated.

The second attraction, at least for some, is the addition of Repels to the Poke
Mart, which keep wild Pokemon at bay on the condition that they're lower-
levelled than the first Pokemon in your party. Grab a few, but don't over-rely
on them or you might miss out on too much Exp. and end up weaker than you'd
hoped.

Methinks it is time to nab another hidden item. Head to the Badge Man's house,
just to the northwest of the house where you won your Bulbasaur. In the garden
behind Badge Man's house is a hidden <RARE CANDY>. Yummy. To get its exact
location, start from the top-rightmost corner, then travel down one tile and
left two tiles before pressing A.

You might want to talk to Badge Man himself for Badge info, but it's not very
thrilling. What is a bit more exciting is that we've got a battle against
Rival-boy coming up soon. I'm going to show you my team, but like I said before
this is just a decent guideline, not a set in stone instruction.
___

My Team

Pikachu     L17 ~ ThunderShock, Thunder Wave, Quick Attack, Double Team
Butterfree  L15 ~ Confusion, PoisonPowder, Stun Spore, Sleep Powder
Spearow     L15 ~ Peck, Growl, Leer, Fury Attack
Geodude     L16 ~ Tackle, Defense Curl, Rock Throw, Mega Punch
Bulbasaur   L10 ~ Tackle, Tail Whip, Leech Seed

Not too shabby at the moment, if I do say so myself. A decent team might run
something along these lines, since I have Electric, Rock, Psychic and Flying
coverage. In Red and Blue you can have a similar team AND your starter. Sweet.
___

Start heading up to Route 24. Get out of Badge Man's house and hang a right,
then take the next available path north for your not-so-long-awaited Rival
battle.

_________________________________________________________

Up first is your Rival's highest level Pokemon--a Flying type. You could
ThunderShock it to death with Pikachu, but Geodude can do a better job with
Rock Throw AND is resistant to both Pidgeotto's and Spearow's moves. Next up in
Red and Blue is Abra, who cannot do anything (Teleport does nothing in Trainer
battles), so use him to get your weakest Pokemon a few good Exp.

In Yellow you get Sandshrew, and you can Vine Whip him into oblivion with your
spanking-new Bulbasaur or just Confusion with Butterfree. Rattata's next up and
is the same as always but with Hyper Fang, a fairly deadly move at this point.
Geodude resists it and it will do laughable damage, so Rock Throw again. Mankey
can also Low Kick it but needs to watch out for Hyper Fang.

Finally, we come to the starters. Charmander drops to Rock Throw from Geodude
and has nothing effective to fire back with, or if you taught Water Gun to
anything it'll fall to that. Keep Geodude away from Squirtle and Bulbasaur
though, because they'll waste him with their 4x super-effective moves! Squirtle
drops to ThunderShock from Pikachu, the only super-effective move we have at
the moment. Bulbasaur falls to Peck from Spearow and Eevee can either face
Geodude with Rock Throw or Mankey with Low Kick. It has no good moves against
Geodude. Watch out for repeated Sand-Attacks that will lower Rock Throw's
already shaky accuracy, though.
___

All things considered, that was fairly easy, right? Drop back down to the Poke
Center in preparation for a journey along Route 24. When you're done, come back
to where you fought your Rival and continue on north.

Fighting types fall to Psychic and Flying type moves, and we have both.
Butterfree works wonders and Spearow is fairly decent too, though he takes
neutral damage from Fighting attacks (Low Kick) whereas Butterfree is 4x
resistant to them.
___

There is a sixth trainer at the end who will hand over a <NUGGET>--an item
which has no use outside of selling for $5000--and then challenge you to a
fight, revealing the group to be a bunch of Rockets. Funnily enough, you can
fight and lose to this guy many times for multiple Nuggets but at this point
you should be finding it hard to lose. Eventually you'll tire of this (I never
even bothered) so step up and take the Rocket challenge.

Hmph. So much for a challenge. Two L15 Pokemon? Sigh. Confusion for Ekans or
Rock Throw if you fear Poison Sting, and either ThunderShock, Confusion or Rock
Throw for Zu'.
___

And that's that for Nugget Bridge. Well, whatever. Yellow players can get their
Charmander now. Talk to the boy at the top of the hill to get him. Also, next
to him is an item ball with <TM45> (Thunder Wave) inside. TM45 is one-of-a-
kind, so keep hold of it if you want.

<CHARMANDER (Y)> - Rating: ***
Charmander is going to require a fair bit of grinding to fit in with the rest
of your team if you want to use him, so I'd start by roasting some nearby Grass
types, which might prove difficult at such a low level. He can evolve into a
fearsome fighter but there are better options out there. For a major power
boost he can use the useful Dig TM which you'll be getting soon.

Next up, it's Pokemon catching time. Head into the grass to your left--but DO
NOT talk to the trainer here yet.

<ODDISH> - Rating: **
First up is Oddish, available in Red and Yellow. If you didn't pick up a
Butterfree earlier (???) then you might want to consider one for learning Sleep
Powder at L19. Otherwise, don't bother. Pokedex fodder.

<BELLSPROUT> - Rating: ****
The Blue version counterpart is Bellsprout, who is also available in Yellow.
Totally superior to Oddish in every way, it has better stats and learns the
best Grass move--Razor Leaf. It gets Sleep Powder at L18 as well. Grab one if
you're dying for a decent Grass type and don't have Bulbasaur/Ivysaur--it'll
provide some great support for the upcoming gym.

<VENONAT (Y)> - Rating: **
Yellow players are exclusively entitled to a Venonat. Venonat and his evolution
are basically better Butterfrees with higher stats, except it takes a lot
longer to learn the moves like Psybeam. Since we're getting rid of 'Free soon
anyway (well, I am), it's best to give this one a miss.

<ABRA> - Rating: **** (Kadabra)
       - Rating: ***** (Alakazam)
Finally we come to Abra, which is about the closest thing to a God Pokemon in
this game if you have the capability to trade. Abra's final evolution,
Alakazam, will tear holes in the opposition. At this point in the game, the
only thing holding Alakazam back from shredding teams apart is the eventual
lack of PP. It has a hideously powerful Special stat (base 135!) and a
fantastic Speed stat (base 120) and comes as early as L16. This thing will
absolutely run circles around the rest of your team for quite a while yet. Yep,
it is game-breakingly strong.

The downsides are that Abra will be a pain to catch because it Teleports away
on its first available turn, without fail. Put it to Sleep to have a much
better chance of catching it. It also learns no attacking moves until it
evolves at L16 and cannot fully evolve without being traded. If you can trade--
get one. If not, get one anyway--one evolution is still very powerful. As of
now it is only available in Red and Blue, but Yellow players can get one very
soon. Red and Blue players should catch a spare Abra to trade for a Mr. Mime
later on.

Basically, grab everything you don't have so far and consider Bellsprout (if
you don't have Bulbasaur) and Abra for your team. Level Abra to L16 for a
powerful Kadabra, then, if you can, trade and trade back with a friend for an
Alakazam, an absolute monstrosity.

In Yellow, if you want to train up Charmander and ditch Spearow, then train on
Oddish, Venonat and Bellsprout, who will all fall to an Ember or two... or
three. Or four. Whatever, as long as they die. If you've still got Spearow,
Peck 'em to death.

After you've trained/caught/whatever, I think it's time for a Box change.
Basically, Pokemon belong to Boxes in your PC, and when one becomes full you
can't catch any more Pokemon. Each Box can hold 20 Pokemon, and you should get
in the habit of changing Boxes just before you hit 20--at about 15 or so. At
the Poke Center, access Someone's PC and change Box, probably to Box 2 or
something. Done and dusted.

Also, you'll probably want to ditch some items, since you can only hold 20 in
your Bag. Deposit items in Your PC for safekeeping. Keep Potions, Poke/Great
Balls, Escape Ropes, Repels and any status recovery items such as Antidotes.
Sell the Nugget.

Whilst you're here, you might as well get some Poke Balls too. Bring the total
up to 10, maybe even 15. More if you're gonna go for Mew, because he's a tricky
******* (whatsit) to catch.
___

The Mew Glitch (Red/Blue only--Yellow can get theirs soon)

What's that? Yes, it's true--through use of an in game glitch, you can obtain
the secret legendary Pokemon, Mew. This is by far the easiest way to get it
(although you can still get one later, if you decide against it now), so
prepare yourself for this entirely optional method for obtaining two Mews.
Yellow players will have to wait for an Abra.

NOTE: I'm pretty sure this won't screw up your save, but it might, so be
warned. I've done it countless times successfully.

Head to Route 24, just above the Nugget Bridge above Cerulean City. Do NOT
fight the trainer hiding in the grass to the left. Now save your game. This
isn't necessary, but recommended. Take careful note of where this trainer is in
the grass and position yourself off-screen such that if you walk down by one
square, he will notice you and challenge you to battle.

Take one step down and simultaneously press Start. You should now be in his
eyesight with the Pause menu displayed. Use Abra to Teleport to Cerulean City,
and you'll notice the guy has the exclamation mark pop up over his head, but
you get lost too quickly for him to catch you. When you arrive in Cerulean
City, your buttons won't work, except movement buttons. This is normal. Enter
Cerulean Gym and battle the Swimmer you see here.

(If you're interested in an instant (cheap) L100 Mew with low stats for a L100
and no natural moves, follow this optional step: Use Growl six times against
his Shellder. Make sure that Growl connects and lowers Shellder's attack six
times)

Waste his Pokemon. They are Horsea and Shellder at L16 and will fall to
Electric and Grass attacks. Leave the Gym and head up Nugget Bridge. The Pause
Menu will display of its own accord, and if you press B now, Mew will appear.
It sounds like a massive hoax, but it works. Mew will be L7 (+/- one level for
each attack modifier on it--If you used Growl six times, the attack modifier
will be -6, making Mew L1).

<MEW>
Mew's a bit broken, in that it possesses the best type in the game, has 100
base stats across the board and can learn every single TM in the game. Yeah,
he's just too powerful to even rank--rest assured it's at least five stars.

It will be a git to catch, but stick with it. Use Sleep-inducing moves if you
have some.

(If you DID make it L1, give it a very low amount of Exp. (less than 54) and it
will skyrocket to L100 due to the way the game's code for Exp. works)

I'd recommend not battling the trainer we scampered from for the entirety of
the game, since he can be used this way to exploit a more advanced version of
this glitch, known as the Ditto Glitch, which allows you to catch ANY Pokemon
on ANY version.

That's all for now. I'll keep you posted as the adventure progresses. Also, I'm
going to write this guide assuming you DON'T have Mew in your main team so that
it's fair to those who don't use the glitch, but you can have him in your team
by all means. Not that you'll need battle strategy with a L100 Mew anyway,
since it learns every TM and HM in the game and will murder EVERYTHING in
sight.

We can get another Mew shortly. I'd use the weaker of the two as a HM slave, if
you want--stick all your HM moves on it later in the game, since it can learn
them all.
___

If you're not interested in the Mew Glitch or the Ditto Glitch, then by all
means fight the trainer in the grass. I keep him free so I can activate the
glitch whenever I want and he's convenient to remember, but if you must fight
him...

_________________________________________________________

Machop is one we haven't come across yet but it's a pure Fighting type, meaning
it falls to Peck from Spearow or Fearow if it's hit L20. Either that or
Confusion from Butterfree, Kadabra (evolve Abra at L16) or Alakazam (evolve
Kadabra by trading). Any of those will waste it with ease. Geodude bites an
aforesaid Confusion, especially from 'Zam, and can otherwise eat Vine Whip from
Bulbasaur/Ivysaur and Bellsprout or a Water Gun from Squirtle/Wartortle.
___

After defeating the Hiker, head north into the gap between the mountainside and
the two trees and examine the north wall for a hidden <ELIXER>. Yes, that is
how it's spelt in this game. You can battle around in the grass now for Pokemon
if you want, but they're essentially the same as Route 24, so maybe not. A bit
to the south and then east is another Hiker.

It'll quickly bite the dust to Electric and Grass attacks.

This is Bill's house. He's a Pokemaniac but the real reason we're here is to
continue the storyline. So go into the house, talk to the Pokemon (?) there and
when Bill asks you to, run the Cell Separation thingy on the PC. Bill will
emerge, so talk to him for a thank you and he'll hand you over the
<S.S.TICKET>. Sweet.

Leave Bill's cottage. If you want, you can re-enter and look and the PC again
to see Bill's favourite Pokemon--Eevee and his evolutions. Their 'Seen' data
will be added to the Pokedex if you do. There's nothing more to do here, so we
might as well leave. From Bill's cottage, head south past to two symmetrical
ponds and then head left, taking a very narrow route back to Cerulean City.

You'll end up near the house that has been robbed. You might notice that the
policewoman out front has stepped aside, allowing you entrance. Head back to
the Poke Center if you need to, but come back here when you're done. Pass
through the house and take the exit at the rear to find the culprit in the back
yard. Take him on!

_________________________________________________________

Okay. Machop shouldn't be too much of a problem if you Confusion him, just make
sure it kills him because Kadabra/Alakazam and Butterfree cannot afford to be
hit by a critical hit Karate Chop. It's Drowzee that's the difficult one:
Disable makes one of your moves unusable for a set time, Pound is nothing to
worry about, Hypnosis will put you to sleep and you've seen the devastating
effects of Confusion. Just use a high level Pokemon with strong moves because
there's nowt that's super-effective against Psychics in RBY (nothing good,
anyway).

If your starter is a high level, use him (unless it's Ivysaur, who is weak to
Confusion). Geodude is slow and will be hit hard by Confusion and crippled by
Hypnosis, Butterfree won't be doing much with a not very effective Confusion
and neither will Kadabra and co. So, use Pikachu, Charmeleon or Wartortle to
bring home the bacon, as long as they're up to par level-wise. If they get put
to sleep, either wait it out and get wailed on by his attacks, or switch out to
another capable team member, such as Fearow, potentially. Good luck--this is
your first taste of the power of Psychic types in this game.
___

Once you beat him, he'll flee and leave you with <TM28> (Dig) in his haste. Dig
is a powerful two-turn Ground move that works against the shoddy AI but won't
serve you too well in competitive matches. Candidates include Sandshrew (if you
have one), Geodude (but he learns Earthquake which is much better), Squirtle
(probably unnecessary, but whatever) and Charmeleon (but he doesn't get STAB).
Oh, and it gets you out of dungeons, just like an Escape Rope. So, give it to
whoever you want. It's a unique item though, so it'll be gone forever if you
use it up now.

Red/Blue players can take on Misty now, as can Yellow players if they want, but
I'm going to run through getting an Abra and a Mew, just for Yellow players,
okay? Actually, Misty could be fought as soon as you reached Cerulean, but I
thought that you'd want to train up a bit beforehand, since her Starmie is
murderous.

Time to head to Route 5 for your Abra, Yellow players. Red and Blue players
might as well tag along for the ride to grab a new Pokemon too. From where you
are after having battled the Rocket, head east some ways and then down between
the two houses to end up next to the gym. The path to the right leads to Route
9, but we can't go that way yet. Head south down the east path--i.e. don't jump
over the ledge on the left or you'll have to circle around this way again. Head
south and follow the path round to the west until you reach downward ledge.
Jump over that to get to the grassy sections of Route 5.

[ ] Jigglypuff (Y)  [ ] Mankey (R)  [ ] Meowth (B)  [ ] Abra (Y)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 18

Yellow players, mope around in the grass and catch yourself an Abra. Sleep
Powder it or you'll lose it. You should also nab a Jigglypuff. Red and Blue
players get a version exclusive here:

<MANKEY (RB)> - Rating: **
Mankey in Red. A decent fighter but not amazing compared to other Pokemon.
Learns Dig by TM and gets some decent physical TMs later on, but evolves late
and doesn't have great moves for the moment.

<MEOWTH> - Rating: ***
Meowth in Blue. A great competitive battler with the right move investment,
much like Sandshrew, but we don't have too many TMs and its primary move,
Slash, doesn't arrive until L44. Learns some good TMs later though.

Okay Yellow players--now that you have an Abra, you're free to get two Mews.
Follow the steps above--the trainers to remember are the Swimmer in Cerulean
Gym and the Slowpoke kid on Route 25. Get started. Once you're done, head back
to Cerulean.

[ ] TM11 (BubbleBeam)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 19

Okay, time to get to work on what I've put off for so long. Once you're done
here, you'll have to ledge-hop all the way down and then trudge around all the
way back up to Cerulean to face the next Gym leader. Let's do it. Rest up via
the Poke Center, then head to the Gym. Misty is just round the corner so it's
time for another team evaluation I think.
___

My Team

Pikachu     L21 ~ ThunderShock, Thunder Wave, Quick Attack, Slam
Butterfree  L16 ~ Confusion, PoisonPowder, Stun Spore, Sleep Powder
Fearow      L20 ~ Peck, Growl, Leer, Fury Attack
Geodude     L18 ~ Tackle, Defense Curl, Rock Throw, Mega Punch
Ivysaur     L16 ~ Tackle, Growl, Leech Seed, Vine Whip
Alakazam    L16 ~ Teleport, Confusion

You'll probably want your Grass Pokemon a bit higher levelled to battle Misty's
Starmie, since Grass is the only thing we have which resists Water (besides
Water itself). Pikachu would also be better off at a higher level--it doesn't
resist Water moves so it'll bite the dust quicker. If you can't get Ivysaur,
I'd highly recommend a Weepinbell, Bellsprout's evolution. Sleep Powder and
Vine Whip should work well against Starmie.

Basically, we need a good Grass type and a decent backup Electric type. For
those without a Grass type, you'll have to make do with what you've got and
plonk a few extra levels on top.
___

Head into Cerulean Gym.

Misty's Gym is based on Water Pokemon, so make sure you're packing good
Electric and Grass types, namely Pikachu for the former and Ivysaur/Weepinbell
for the latter.

The first trainer you'll encounter here is a Swimmer, though if you did the Mew
Glitch on him you won't have to face him, obviously. You can avoid him if you
want, but why bother? Just think about that yummy delicious Exp. Hmmm... Exp...

It has no Water attacks and one Flying attack, so pass on the Grass Pokemon and
use Pikachu instead, who resists Flying moves. ThunderShock, ThunderShock.
Supersonic, if it hits, will annoy you with confusion status, so perhaps switch
out if this happens to Geodude or something that also resists Peck.
___

Okay, head back to the Poke Center and perhaps grab some Potions because Misty
is no joke. Be sure to save beforehand.

 ~ Tackle, Water Gun, Harden, BubbleBeam
_________________________________________________________

Staryu's not even worth talking about--if you have trouble with that, then
Starmie will absolutely demolish your team. It's a ferocious Special attacker
with fearsome Speed, a tough set of Water moves, and to top that all off, Misty
will pump it with X Defend and it will use Harden on itself.

Advice: Don't bring out your best Pokemon against Staryu. Any amount of
weakening done to your best Pokemon lowers its chances of being able to take on
Starmie. I assume you're using Ivysaur/Weepinbell to take on Starmie, so
Pikachu will do fine against Staryu.

Good, now that that's out of the way we can focus on the main attraction. If
you have Weepinbell, you're set--Sleep Powder + Vine Whip = win. Ivysaur will
do just as well, though it can't put things to sleep (yet). You might want to
keep ThunderShocking with Pikachu until Pikachu dies, just to soften Starmie up
for a major beat down by your Grass type (that's what I did).  Red players with
Wartortle or Charmeleon are going to have the hardest time without any decent
Grass Pokemon. The best I can advise is to use Sleep Powder with Butterfree and
then Shock with Pikachu, switching back when it wakes up. If you can't win this
way, gain a few levels and come back. That's all there is.
___

Yummy rewards in store include the CascadeBadge, <TM11> (BubbleBeam) and some
money. The CascadeBadge gives you the power to control traded Pokemon at L30
and under (previously the cap was L10) and the ability to use Cut outside of
battle. Neat. BubbleBeam is worth teaching to your Water Pokemon if you want to
use it up now and not wait for the Missingno. Glitch. So, if you want, teach
away.

Okay, time to move on. Heal up at the Poke Center, then head around that
strange wacky way through the burgled house out of Cerulean towards the south
to Route 5 again.
_______

Route 5
_______

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 20

If you decide to ledge hop here down the middle path, you'll pass the Day Care
Center, a place where you can leave one Pokemon for a small fee to gain 1 Exp.
per step you take. Sounds okay and it's fairly cheap, but the Pokemon in here
will automatically delete the fourth move in their list to make way for new
ones and will never evolve until they're out again. Verdict? Only use for weak
Pokemon that need Exp. like Magikarp and keep an eye on their levels very
closely. By the way, the fee is $100 plus $100 for every level the Pokemon
gains, due upon collection of said Pokemon.

Head to the south and enter the little building to the east, because the guards
won't let you through to Saffron City in the big building to the south. In the
small house here are a set of stairs leading to the Underground Path and a girl
here who will offer to trade a Nidoran F for a Nidoran M in Red/Blue, but
that's fairly pointless.

Cubone for Machoke in Yellow is much better as Machoke will evolve upon being
traded into a very power Fighting Pokemon, Machamp. Excellent. I'll remind you
when we get a Cubone. Take the stairs here.

Two hidden items lurk in this Underground Path. The first resides two tiles to

second item is farther down near the bottom. Starting from the tile to the
right of the bottommost stairs, move one tile right and six tiles up. Press A
to uncover your very own <X SPECIAL>. That's all here. Take the bottom stairs
to exit the Underground Path. A nice short chapter for me.

have to deal with Confusion which doesn't help, whereas Yellow players get
Supersonic instead which is equally annoying, although if you play smart it
can't kill you. Thankfully, we have lots to throw at it--Ember, Peck,
ThunderShock and especially Rock Throw deal massive damage, so take your pick.
Expect to sacrifice at least one Pokemon to a crippling status effect like
sleep or paralysis. Just throw your fastest and most powerful moves Pokemon at
it and you should emerge victorious. If your Butterfree or Weepinbell is
faster, put it to Sleep and hammer away.

[ ] Farfetch'd (RB)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 21

First order of business is, as always, the Poke Center. Heal up and whatever,
then poke your head into the house next door on the left. Agree with the old
coot that fishing is swell and nab yourself the mighty <OLD ROD>, capable of
catching many a Magikarp. If you didn't buy one earlier, why not try it out now
in the city and grab yourself one?

Below the Poke Center and are two houses. The one on the left is the Pokemon
Fan Club. Talk to the leader to hear him drone on about Rapidash and receive a
<BIKE VOUCHER>. If you want, head to Cerulean and grab it now--but trust me,
it's not worth the trek yet since we'll be going past it later. I'll remind you
about it in due time.

In Red and Blue only, the house on the right contains a little girl in search
of Spearow, which she will trade for a Farfetch'd. It's well worth it since
this is the only one in the game.

<FARFETCH'D> - Rating: *
They're terrible Pokemon which I would seriously advise not using, but you get
one step closer to finishing your Pokedex. Though it does make a useful HM
slave with Cut and Fly.

Might as well check out the Poke Mart and stock up on the brand new Super
Potion, which heals 50HP at a whopping $700 a pop. Err... maybe not. Get a few
for emergencies, but I find them too expensive to warrant buying too many.

The gym is unreachable at the moment so don't worry about it just yet. And
that's all for Vermilion, at the moment. We have to do the S.S. Anne to advance
the story but before we do I'm sure you wouldn't mind obtaining a few extra
Pokemon and wailing on some trainers, would you? Thought so. Head east out of
Vermilion City and enter the cave to the north that you stumble across.

[ ] Diglett  ( ) Dugtrio

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 21

It is worth saving repeatedly as you trek through this dangerous cave, as a
random encounter with Dugtrio will likely be the end of you at this point. It's
too fast to run from and too high-levelled to beat. You might think it is a
wise idea to use Repels. Wrong. Repels keep Pokemon lower-levelled than your
first party member at bay. Since you probably have nothing over L31, if you use
a Repel all you'll be seeing is Dugtrio. Not good.

<DIGLETT> - Rating: *****
Catch yourself a Diglett or even a Dugtrio if you've got the guts. Diglett is
lightning fast and scores critical hits like there's no tomorrow, but his
defenses are paper thin. Pretty much the opposite to Golem. He gets Dig
naturally--so you can save the TM for something else--and a powerful Slash
attack from a respectable base 80 Attack. He'll absolutely obliterate the next
Gym and if you can catch him as a Dugtrio he'll surely be the best Pokemon on
your team.

This cave is a fantastic training area; just be wary of Dugtrio. You'll get
about 200 Exp. a pop from each Diglett and 600 or so from a Dugtrio. When
you're all done, go back out of the cave and head even farther east into a new
Route.

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 21

Okay, we're on Route 11. 'Any new Pokemon, Zerokid?' I hear you ask. Funny you
should mention that. For Red and Blue players, a Spearow can be found and
traded for the only Farfetch'd in the game if you haven't done so already.

<DROWZEE> - Rating: ****
The only new Pokemon here is Drowzee, a strong Psychic type. Not quite as
powerful as Alakazam but not anywhere near as fragile either. To cut to the
chase, the evolution, Hypno, is a much slower and slightly weaker version of
Alakazam, but it has below average defenses as opposed to simply awful ones. If
you can't get Alakazam (because of trading issues), consider a Hypno, as
Kadabra's frail defences might leave you wanting.

The first trainer you come across by taking the pathway itches for a fight.

Hypnosis can be very annoying, especially on slow Pokemon. Use a fast attacker
such as Pikachu or Alakazam to take out Poliwag. Perhaps even put it to sleep
first with Butterfree/Weepinbell. ThunderShock or Vine Whip for Horsea.
___

Interestingly enough, those guys were renamed to 'Gamers' in Fire Red and Leaf
Green (the remakes of RBY). Something about not encouraging gambling. Anyhoo,
take the dirt path heading east above you. When you come to an intersection,

Dig from Diglett or anyone else will destory it, otherwise something like Rock
Throw from Geodude should do the trick.

Dig is crying out to be used here. Again, watch out for SonicBoom from the
illegal Magneton (shouldn't evolve until L30) and it also carries ThunderShock
so keep Wartortle and Fearow at bay. Geodude and Dugtrio are immune to it
because they are Ground types.

Low Kick, on the off chance that you have it, otherwise use Geodude to resist
Hyper Fang.
___

The rock just above the Lookout Station houses a hidden <ESCAPE ROPE>, so grab
it. Now, if you've been catching everything I've mentioned so far, you should
be close to having 30 full entries in your Pokedex. I was just under at 28. If
this is the case, evolve something like Weedle twice (final form Beedrill comes
at L10) or something useless to fill out your Dex. If you then proceed to the
Lookout Station and head upstairs, you can speak to Prof. Oak's Aide and
receive the <ITEMFINDER>. When activated, it bleeps if hidden items are nearby.
It's useless with this guide at your side, though...

Also up here is a boy who will trade Nidorina for Nidorino in Red and Blue and
Dugtrio for Lickitung in Yellow. Both pointless trades, really. You could have
trained up a Nidoran M if you wanted to evolve it, but I figured we might as
well catch one a bit later and not waste time training an extra Pokemon now.
I'll remind you to snag a Nidorino and come back here later on, 'kay? Likewise
for Yellow players who won't have a Lickitung yet--I'll tell you when to come
back.

Exit the guardhouse to the right to briefly enter Route 12.

Examine the second south tree that's sticking out into the main path for a

Vermilion City. Get yourself to the Poke Center and heal up if you want (you
might also want to deposit some items in the PC, since the S.S. Anne has quite
a few), but ultimately you'll want to board the S.S. Anne to the south of the
city.

This is the S.S. Anne. Yup, you've guessed it--another bunch of trainers in
what is essentially a thinly-disguised dungeon without any Pokemon to catch. Oh
joy. Might as well get started. If you need to heal on the S.S. Anne, you can
head to Vermilion Poke Center. However, once you have received HM01 (Cut) from
the captain, the ship will depart as soon as you leave it so you CANNOT heal
using the Poke Center after obtaining this item! This guide gets the HM01 after
defeating all the trainers so if you follow the guide you'll be okay.

Head south from the entrance and take the east path at the crossroads. Take the
first door you come across (looks like an indent in the south wall) to

Two Growlithes. They fall to Water attacks from Wartortle, Rock attacks from

attackers such as Dugtrio should be careful of getting a Burn, as it hampers
your attacking prowess by quite a bit.

After the fight, head east along the corridor, following it and taking the
stairs at the end. Take the first door you see and take the item ball

ThunderShock or Vine Whip make quick work of it. Pikachu's noticeably lagging

For sucking so bad, you are allowed to steal their <TM44> (Rest). A great move
for defensive Pokemon that heals their health to full and rids them of any
status ailments at the cost of two turns of Sleep. You have a few Pokemon that
could use it now (if not all of them) but since they're probably all offensive
Pokemon, you're better off saving it. The last room on your left has some more

___

Skip the next two rooms because they only contain clueless idiots who don't
want to fight, but take the one after that to find a room containing two
trainers. You might want to position yourself so as to not have to fight them
one straight after the other with the same Pokemon out first. First go one
square down, then one square to the right to avoid this and fight them
separately, Youngster first.

Pidgey falls to ThunderShock but deals fairly hefty damage to 'Chu so you can
use Graveler/Golem to lay the smackdown on it and resist all its moves. Yeah.
Nidoran F gets crippled by Confusion or Dig.
___

After defeating these two bozos, pick up <TM08> (Body Slam), a powerful Normal
type move with a 30% chance of paralysis. Sweet. Very good for all physical
attackers, especially Normal types. If you're cloning with Missingno. later on,
then don't waste it now. Unless you're saving it for any reason, a good choice
now would be Golem if you have one. The paralysis chance helps him with his low
Speed.

Okay, back out on the main deck there's nothing more for you here, so head down
the west side of the ship, avoiding the stairs here and entering the doorway at
the bottom to emerge in the kitchen. Examine the lowest bin on the right hand
side for a hidden <GREAT BALL>, a ball providing 1.5x as much success as a Poke
Ball. Good stuff. Exit the kitchen.

I used the Poke Center at this point (Kadabra/Alakazam can teleport you after
you get outside). Once you're done, if you decide to go, take the stairs to the
north that I told you to ignore earlier. Then head south and take the stairs
here, too.

This hallway contains nothing of importance so just head to the end to emerge
on the outer deck of the ship, where two Sailors await battle. The first one is
right in front of you as you emerge:

___

Well that was fun. Head back through the hallway and emerge through the stairs
at the opposite end. The first door to your right contains a bloke who will
give you 'Seen' data about Snorlax for your Pokedex, but it's not essential as
you can catch one (or two) later in the game anyway. The next room on your
right has two trainers.

Pikachu is basically shut down by Ground types so Golem or Dugtrio (whatever)
will render it useless. Yellow players will find it harder--Golem will resist
their attacks but SonicBoom and especially Self-Destruct will hurt a LOT. Just
be careful, save and reset if things don't go as planned.
___

Take their <MAX ETHER> and leave. Don't ever sell or use up your stock of Max
Ethers or they'll be gone forever.

Ignore the next room. The room after contains two more trainers. Like before,
you have to manoeuvre yourself into a position whereby you don't have to fight
both trainers with your top Pokemon, so step one to the left and one to the
north to avoid this.

Take it out ASAP with either Fighting moves or just powerful Pokemon.
___

Nab the <RARE CANDY> here but probably don't use it yet. Head outside and
continue to the right because there are no more trainers here. As you head
upwards to the captain's room, your Rival will appear... And I'm going to show
you my team, as always.
___

My Team

Pikachu     L21 ~ ThunderShock, Thunder Wave, Quick Attack, Slam
Butterfree  L16 ~ Confusion, PoisonPowder, Stun Spore, Sleep Powder
Fearow      L20 ~ Peck, Growl, Leer, Fury Attack
Golem       L25 ~ Tackle, Rock Throw, Mega Punch, Selfdestruct
Ivysaur     L22 ~ Tackle, Leech Seed, Vine Whip, PoisonPowder
Alakazam    L25 ~ Teleport, Confusion, Disable

My main attackers are far and away Golem and Alakazam. Golem is a slow,
powerful physical core, whereas Alakazam takes care of the special side of
things. If Golem has Dig, his coverage is even better, and with Body Slam
you're just going for overkill. But this doesn't have to be the case--he's
powerful enough with Rock Throw. Golem has to be L25 to have evolved, but
Alakazam need not be this high.

Everything else is mostly for coverage, and Butterfree is just filler now that
Alakazam is here. It's mostly for Sleep Powder to help catch stuff. If you
can't trade, then Hypno and Dugtrio are solid but inferior choices to Alakazam
and Golem respectively, though the pre-evolutions Kadabra and Graveler are also
good choices. Make up your mind...

Okay, well if you're ready, so am I. Bring it!

_________________________________________________________

This fight is so easy it's untrue. Your rival has evolved his Pokemon but their
levels are barely any different from last time, whereas your levels should be
sky-high in comparison. First, Red and Blue. Pidgeotto gets dropped by Rock
Throw and Raticate can't handle Golem either. Kadabra now has Confusion and is
weak to nothing, really, so hit him hard with something like your starter (as
long as it's not Ivysaur) or Fearow or something. He'll drop to physical
attacks. Finally, his starter. Ivysaur hates Peck and Confusion, Charmeleon
hates Water Gun/BubbleBeam, Rock Throw and Dig, and Wartortle hates
ThunderShock and Vine Whip (you're better off with the latter). Remember to use
Butterfree/Weepinbell's Sleep Powder for a cheap way of winning if you can't
hack it through traditional beat down methods.

Yellow is even easier, if possible. Spearow falls to ThunderShock or, like
Eevee and Rattata, can face Golem for a quick and easy victory on your behalf.
Sandshrew bites the dust (or sand) to Water and Grass attacks, but beware of
critical hits from Slash which will put a dent in your Pokemon. And that's all
there is really. Victory is yours. Again, Sleep Powder can save the day if you
get your knickers in a twist.
___

After the fight, head north and then take the stairs to the captain's quarters.
Speak to him and rub his back (eww) for the elusive and magical <HM01> (Cut).
HM's differ to TMs in that they can be used more than once. They all have field
effects as well, whereas TMs mostly don't except for a select few. You will
need to teach someone Cut to complete the storyline, but it's an awful battling
move so wait until we get out of the S.S. Anne and teach it to someone like
Oddish or something useless like that. Oh, and HM's can never be forgotten
(unless you trade to Gold/Silver/Crystal, but enough about that), so make sure
it IS something useless that you put it on.

Cut cuts down certain cactus-looking trees in the field and can also be used to
cut patches of grass so that you don't have to fight wild Pokemon there. Sweet.
Everything grows back when you move into another area though. We're done here
on the S.S. Anne now. Backtrack to the entrance. As soon as you leave, the S.S.
Anne will depart. Such a shame--not.

Go heal up and stuff. If you want to get yourself a Mr. Mime and the HM for
Flash (neither of which is necessary, but the latter is INCREDIBLY useful),
it'll take a bit of side tracking. Whilst at the Poke Center, Red/Blue players
will want to take out their spare Abra and Yellow players their Clefairy to
swap for said Mr. Mime. Ooh, exciting. If you need to deposit something,
deposit Butterfree or Pikachu. I know he lets out a whine in Yellow and you
might not want to, but he is fairly useless for this bit.

Oh, and you need to take out someone who knows the HM Cut. Oddish is a prime
candidate for teaching, as is your spare Mew if you caught two. Mew is a great
HM slave! Either way, while you're here you might as well deposit all useless
items or items that you're not going to use in the PC, such as the S.S. Ticket,
Rare Candies, HM01 and any unused TMs etc. They take up valuable item space
(you can only hold up to 20 at one time).

Remember Diglett's Cave off Route 11 to the east? After healing up, please head
on over there. Dugtrio is still as deadly as ever, so I'd encourage saving very
often, so that you don't have to backtrack too far if one screws you over.
Don't use any Repels; just follow the very linear path right to the end.

Yeah, of all the places, we end up back at Route 2, right outside Pewter City.
Coolio. Once you emerge, you can head west and cut the tree here to go to
Pewter City. At the north point of the city is the museum, and now, armed with
Cut, you can hack your way into the secret entrance on the right-hand side of
the museum. Inside, talk to the guy for a well-deserved <OLD AMBER>. We can't
do much with it yet, but I will, in due time, let you know when it becomes
useful.

Head back to where you exited Diglett's Cave and head south into the first
house you see. The person at the top in this house will trade you a Mr. Mime
for your Clefairy (Yellow) or Abra (Red and Blue).

<MR. MIME> - Rating: ***
Mimey is a thoroughly average Psychic Pokemon which isn't in the same league as
Hypno or Alakazam, though it is faster than the former. Not really worth the
effort, and he doesn't even have the decency to evolve into something cool. He
does, however, get boosted EXP. and has decent stats to run with. But he's a
creepy clown, so... I don't like it.

Head south into the Lookout Station and speak to the scientist here. This is
another of Oak's Aides and he will give you <HM05> (Flash) if you've collected
10 Pokemon, which I sincerely hope you have. Flash isn't necessary for game
completion but very helpful for dark caves and such, otherwise you can't see
where you're going.

Head south through the Station and pick up the two items out in the field here,
a <HP UP> and a <MOON STONE>. You can cut the trees here to get back to
Viridian City, which I recommend doing for one thing. Head to the Poke Center
in Viridian and then go straight left. You'll encounter a pond with a Cut tree
above it. Cut the tree and talk to the weirdo in this enclosed area for <TM42>
(Dream Eater), before heading back through Diglett's Cave to Vermilion City.

really changed... so go into the Gym and start with the Sailor on the left.

who can go for the 2HKO with Confusion.

___

Now that all the preliminary warm-ups are outta here, we have to tackle this
Gym's rather annoying electric lock puzzle. Essentially, the rubbish bins here
contain two electric locks. Only one will appear at first, and when you find it
another one will appear in a random adjacent bin (one square across from it
horizontally or vertically). If you don't guess the second one correctly, the
first one resets, thus disappearing and making you try again. Once you've
opened the first lock, the second appears in ANY adjacent slot, even if you've
already checked it! So it's just a guessing game and you'll get it right in the
end. Once the door is open, it's time to fight. Remember to save beforehand.

_________________________________________________________

Lt. Surge uses X Speed on his already fast Pokemon to crank their Speed up to
ridiculous levels. Since Golem is about a billion times slower anyway, Lt.
Surge essentially just wastes turns. If you do have a full health Golem, you
don't really need much strategy. If your Golem has Dig, even better. In Red and
Blue, once the SonicBoomer is down, nothing can stop you. Quick Attack is
laughable and the Electric moves will do nothing to you. Dugtrio also does
fairly well with STAB super-effective attacks and immunity to Electric, but
repeated Quick Attacks/SonicBooms/Mega Punches/Kicks will wear it down
eventually. No need to even fear Raichu's level--I had a L26 Golem which took
16HP damage from a critical hit Mega Kick. Golem's Defense is just so fantastic
so there's no need to worry.

Now, that's the Ground types sorted--you won't need much strategy with them as
Lt. Surge can't scratch you. If you have no Ground types, Grass types resist
Electric attacks somewhat and can try to beat them up with Vine Whip. Sleep
Powder is always a cheap option, though a miss can be very costly for
Butterfree if you get hit by Thunderbolt! Try to be careful of Pikachu's
paralysis in RBY and keep these guys away: Water types will get killed and so
will fliers while everything else will either be neutral or resist it. I guess
if you have no Ground types you should just pound on it with anything but
Electric and Flying attacks. You'll pull through in the end.
___

For your valiant efforts, Lt. Surge awards you the ThunderBadge. Not only are
you now allowed to use the HM Fly out of battle effects (more on that later),
but all your Pokemon's Speed stats are invisibly increased to 9/8ths of the
original value for in-game battles. Nifty.

You also get some cash and <TM24> (Thunderbolt), a fantastic Electric move.
With 100% accuracy and 95 base power, it's the most reliable Electric move in
the game (as opposed to a 70% accurate Thunder with 120 base power) and will
serve you very well. Yellow players' Pikachus will get it at L26 anyway though
and I'm not sure you should use it on something like Pikachu in Red and Blue.
Save it for Zapdos or another worthy Electric type like Jolteon.

Well, we're done here. Yellow players should talk to the female police officer
in the centre of town for a free L10 Squirtle!

<SQUIRTLE (Y)> - Rating: ***
Neat, though it's probably too low-levelled to consider making part of your
team unless you are very dedicated. Still, Water types are very solid and
Blastoise has some very well-rounded stats. Give him the BubbleBeam TM for
Cerulean and take him east to Diglett Cave for some quick training, if you
want.

Now return to Cerulean City, through Route 6, the Underground Path and Route 5.
When heading through grassy routes remember that you can Cut grass to avoid
wild Pokemon.

When you arrive in Cerulean, head to the Bicycle Shop at the southwest of the
city and exchange your Bike Voucher for a <BICYCLE>, one of the most useful but
nonessential items in the game--it speeds up travelling time! Put it at the top
of your item list (use Select to switch items slots around) because you'll want
it there. While you're here, you might as well deposit all items and junk in
the PC too, and buy a few Poke Balls because we'll be traversing another cave
system soon.

Keep a Cut user in your party for the road ahead. Now head to the east section
of the city. From the Poke Center, go west, north through the tiny ledge, east,
through the house that has been burgled and then east towards a cut-able tree.

Status afflictions galore. Use a fast super-effective Pokemon such as Alakazam,
but Hypno or Fearow prove useful as well. Charmeleon is a tad slow and under-
powered because he hasn't evolved yet and will likely get hit by every status
ailment under the sun. Just be careful.
___

Drop down two ledges and collect the item ball here for <TM30> (Teleport). If
you had Abra/Kadabra/Alakazam, you'll know what this move does. Most Psychic
Pokemon can learn it and a few others. It's useless in battle, but teleports
you from the field to the last used Poke Center, which is handy enough. It only
teleports you from OUTSIDE a cave or dungeon, unlike Dig which does the
opposite. So you might need both. Head east and fight the trainer here.

stuff if you haven't already got it. A few evolutions make an appearance in
Yellow, but you've already had the opportunity to catch the base forms so you
shouldn't need anything if you've been vigilant so far.

Below the grass is a ledge. To the right of this ledge is a rock which contains
a hidden <ETHER>. Woohoo! Once you're done here, head past the two previous
trainers, take the next available path east and then jump over the ledge here.
Head all the way right and you'll bump into another trainer.

The grass here contains a few new Pokemon as listed above, but don't worry--
they'll all be available in all versions soon enough.

<MACHOP> - Rating: ** (Machoke)
         - Rating: *** (Machamp)
Machop is a nice Fighting Pokemon, but it needs to be traded and given TMs to
reach its full potential, and is unfortunately weak against Psychics. Awesome
offensively, but a bit slow and Submission will hurt you quite a bit.

<MAGNEMITE> - Rating: ***
Magnemite is a powerful but slow Electric type with a hideously shallow
movepool, and it only learns ThunderShock naturally in terms of level-up moves
at L25, which is about as good as it gets. No thanks.

<VOLTORB> - Rating: ***
Finally we get to Voltorb, a blisteringly fast Electric type... that gets
horrific moves via level-up (no STAB moves!) and only gets good moves when
given TMs. You'll have to give both of these guys the Thunderbolt TM to see any
use from them.

Yellow players shouldn't fret about getting a Machop straight away, because
they're much more common in Rock Tunnel, which is just around the corner.
Literally. Head down, heal up in the Poke Center if necessary and then head up
around the tree blockade to battle a trainer.

A hidden <SUPER POTION> resides in the tile to the right of the entrance to
Rock Tunnel. You'll need Cut to access it. Also, a hidden <MAX ETHER> lies
inside the tree to the east of the Rock Tunnel exit. Afterwards, heal up at the
Poke Center and bring out something that can use Flash for the caves ahead.
There are 19 trainers to take care of in Rock Tunnel, so get yourself prepared.

[ ] Machop (RB)  [ ] Onix

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 25

Set yourself up with Flash (I taught it to Butterfree) to make your life a lot
easier.

<ONIX> - Rating: *
Knock around for an Onix in Red and Blue (Yellow players must do it on the next
floor)--a thoroughly inferior Pokemon to Golem--and a Machop if you don't have
one. Onix is a terrible Pokemon in every way, his only standout stat being
Defense. Eesh. His offensive power is miserable.

Approach the Pokemaniac at the intersection to the southeast.

I used Ivysaur's Vine Whip to knock 'em out. Beware Slowpoke's Confusion if you
do this, or consider using Pikachu. You'll notice that Pikachu is severely
underpowered now.
___

Take the south path here and follow it around to the east and north to a
ladder, which you should descend. Head southwest from this large space to get
to a narrower pathway, along which you will encounter a trainer.

This is the first time you've seen Graveler (unless, of course, you raised one
yourself) and its just a beefed up Geodude. Again, be very wary of Selfdestruct
if you can't take them both out in one hit. Consider saving beforehand and
resetting if they obliterate one of your Pokemon.

Lavender Town is the graveyard of the Pokemon world and there have even been
claims of people getting depressed by the music here (hop on your bicycle if
this is the case for you--that's much more jolly). There's a seven floor
pseudo-dungeon full of ghosts to take care of here, but not yet, so don't hold
your breath. In fact, there's very little to do in Lavender Town for the
moment. Stop numero uno would be the Poke Center of course, since your 'Mons
most likely took quite a thrashing while traversing Rock Tunnel.

Once you're all done there, there are two more mini-attractions to visit. The
first is the Name Rater's house, more commonly known as the nickname changer.
Any Pokemon that has the same Trainer ID as you (everything you've caught, plus
some others if you're incredibly lucky) can have its nickname changed to
whatever you want. He is located in the house to the left of the Poke Mart,
which is the other draw of this town.

Located in the southeast corner of town, the Poke Mart now sells Great Balls,
as you can see from above. They're three times as expensive as regular Poke
Balls but boast a 1.5x capture rate by comparison. In all honesty, I stick to
regular Poke Balls most of the time and just use status conditions (Sleep,
paralysis, etc.) to raise the capture raise that way. I'd still recommend
getting a few (maybe five?) for those really stubborn Pokemon. Oh, and if you
don't have any Poke Balls now, then this is all you can buy from Lavender, so
tough luck.

If you want to bag yourself a fairly useless TM for collection purposes, take
the south road out of Lavender into Route 12.

perform an accuracy check so is guaranteed to hit, even when the opponent is
underground through Dig, for example. Once you've got it, head back to
Lavender. Take a Cut user out of your PC if you want the next Route's wild
Pokemon, then take the west exit.

___

To your left now is a cut bush which gives way to this Route's only patch of
Tall Grass. Red and Blue players get their version exclusive Fire type on this
Route, which will come in handy for the next Gym if you've a spare spot in your
team since the Gym is Grass type. Excellent.

<VULPIX> - Rating: **
<GROWLITHE> - Rating: ***
Growlithe in Red has the coolness factor, which is more often than not the
deciding factor when I build my teams, but in Blue you instead have the
awesomely cool Ninetales--the evolution of Vulpix. Bear in mind that Vulpix
gets Flamethrower at L35 whereas Growlithe gets it at L50! Ninetales also has
better stats where it counts, a faster rate of Exp. gain and access to the
useful Confuse Ray. However, Growlithe can muscle through opponents with his
ridiculously powerful stats across the board, taking advantage of the Dig TM
primarily. They can both evolve with the Fire Stone very soon.

Of course, if you've been raising a Charmander, then you really have no need
for either of these guys, unless one of them really floats your boat. After
that, keep following the path around to the north.

There's nought to do here so, starting from the west stairs, take three paces
up and nine paces east to uncover the square in front of you for a <NUGGET>.
Now move down to the bottom and move another nine paces east to uncover the
<ELIXER> in front of you. Woo!

I love short chapters. It makes me feel like there's not too far to go--but
deep down I know there's still more than half a guide to do, not including the

New Pokemon
-----------
[ ] Eevee

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 27

Unlike Lavender Town, there's a truckload to do in Celadon. First stop (after
the Poke Center, of course) is the Celadon Mansion to bag yourself an Eevee.
Instead of taking the main entrance, though, from the terminus of Route 7 take
an immediate north into a narrow pathway. Follow this path along until there is
a gap in the hedges to the north. Exit through this gap and to your west is
another gap in the trees right behind a building. Walk into the gap here and
into the building to enter through a secret back door. Cool. Once inside, climb
the flights of stairs to the top, take the door to the room below and swipe the
Eevee on the table. Well, finders keepers.

Eevee itself is an interesting Pokemon, evolving into one of three elemental
forms based on which corresponding Stone you give it. You'll either get the
Water based Vaporeon, the Electric Pokemon Jolteon or the Fire beast Flareon.
In terms of usefulness, Jolteon is probably the best, but we can get all three
of them via glitches anyway--or if you can trade to GSC, you can breed for
another Eevee and evolve that one differently. Your choice. All three of them
are cool though. Eevee comes at L25 and you can buy the Stones in just a
second, so slotting it into a gap on your team should be no trouble at all. It
evolves using either a Water, Thunder or Fire Stone, into Vaporeon, Jolteon or
Flareon respectively. Leaf Stone gets no love.

<VAPOREON> - Rating: ****
<JOLTEON> - Rating: ****
<FLAREON> - Rating: **
Vaporeon and Jolteon are great additions, being some of the most powerful and
useful Pokemon of their respective types. I'd definitely get one of these guys,
but I'd avoid Flareon completely, since she's trash.

Now head back out. From the Poke Center, take the path southwest of you. If you
have Cut on you, head east through the gap between the houses and the fencing
and cut the tree here. If you don't have Cut, you'll have to go the long way,
which you can do by heading south, then west, south, east and north immediately
each time. Head north and examine the hedge at the dead end for a <PP UP>,
which increases the maximum PP for a selected Pokemon's move by 20%. They're
limited in number, so save one for duplication.

Now head south past the Cut tree and then take a left. The first building on
the east here has an invisible PC in the top-right corner in Red and Blue,
incidentally. Turn your attention to the west-most available house in this
terrace block. Inside, there is a man in the top left corner who will fork over
the <COIN CASE>, which is used to store special Coins for gambling with at the
Game Corner. I'll explore that a bit later, but first I want to go to Celadon
Department Store.

Located to the left of Celadon Mansion's main entrance, the Department Store is
the biggest Poke Mart in Kanto and has pretty much everything. Lots of the
stuff we won't need yet, but I'll advise you what to get for now.

1F is the Service Counter and has nothing of interest. The two ways of
traversing this store are to climb the stairs manually at the top right of the
store, or use the lift, located in the top left of the store and activated
through the panel on the wall inside. Get to the second floor, 2F--the
Trainer's Market--to stock up on Great Balls and general items from the guy on
the right and a few naff TMs from the guy on the left.

Most notable of these are TM01 (Mega Punch), if you used one up already from
Mt. Moon; TM32 (Double Team), which boosts your Evade to can't hit levels; TM33
(Reflect), which doubles your team's Defense for five turns; and TM17
(Submission), a powerful Fighting type move with 25% recoil.

Of special note is TM07 (Horn Drill). OHKO moves suck in general, given that
you have to be faster than the foe and they're only ~30% accurate. However, if
you're faster than the foe, you can use an X Accuracy to boost your Pokemon's
Accuracy to 99.6% until the battle ends or that Pokemon switches out. And yes,
you can buy X Accuracys by the truckload from this very store... If you're
shameless, feel free to use this 'strategy' from now on.

On to the third floor, 3F, the TV Game Shop, where you can't buy anything. You
can, however, talk to the guy behind the counter for, well, <TM18> (Counter).
Though it is glitched in this game because it only counters Normal and Fighting
type moves (see Movedex for more details), some people still find it useful for
competitive matches.

4F, the fourth floor, is the Wiseman Gifts store. Here you can purchase
elemental Stones to evolve Pokemon for a paltry $2100 each. Bargain! Stone
evolution usually means that the Pokemon don't learn moves very well anymore
though, so check the Pokedex I've provided for details. They also sell the Poke
Doll, of which I would buy one for a future mini-quest to get a TM.

The following Pokemon evolve by Elemental Stone:
Pikachu --> Raichu (Thunderstone) (R/B)
Vulpix --> Ninetales (Fire Stone)
Gloom --> Vileplume (Leaf Stone)
Growlithe --> Arcanine (Fire Stone)
Poliwhirl --> Poliwrath (Water Stone)
Weepinbell --> Victreebel (Leaf Stone)
Shellder --> Cloyster (Water Stone)
Exeggcute --> Exeggutor (Leaf Stone)
Staryu --> Starmie (Water Stone)
Eevee --> Vaporeon (Water Stone)
      --> Jolteon (Thunderstone)
      --> Flareon (Fire Stone)

The last numbered floor, 5F, is the Drug Store, and this is where you'll come
to boost your Pokemon's stats for the ultimate team. The prices are far too
hefty now at nearly 10,000 Poke Dollars a pop, but keep it in mind for later.
You can also buy temporary stat boosters here such as X Defend, X Accuracy and
Guard Spec., but I tend not to bother with those.

You'll have to take the stairs for the next level, the Rooftop Square. From the
vending machines here you can purchase drinks. Fresh Water, Soda Pop and
Lemonade heal 50, 60 and 80 HP respectively and are a much cheaper alternative
to Potions, but you can only buy one at a time so it is rather irritating.
You'll want to buy one of each though, since they can be traded in to the
thirsty girl on the right for <TM13> (Ice Beam), <TM48> (Rock Slide) and <TM49>
(Tri Attack) respectively.

Ice Beam is a fantastic move for any Water or Ice type, since it hits lots of
types super-effectively, including the rare Dragon types, so you will most
likely need it for the Elite Four later on. Rock Slide is a decent move at
best, but it's the best Rock type move in the entire game so you'd be wise to
teach it to Golem or something unless you're saving it to duplicate. Lastly,
Tri Attack doesn't have the side effects it does in later generations (causing
one of three status conditions) and so just becomes a decently powered Normal
move with low PP. See the Movedex for more details if you're interested.

Purchase an extra Fresh Water for later purposes (it can be any drink actually,
but Fresh Water is the cheapest) and get outta here. Phew!

Now that you're done shopping, grab a Pokemon that knows Cut, then take the
west exit out of Celadon City. We'll be back soon, I promise.

( ) Raticate (RB)  ( ) Fearow (Y)  [ ] Doduo

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 27

As you head west on this Route, but before you come to the sleeping Pokemon
blocking your way, you'll pass a cut-able tree. Cut it down, then head into the
grass for a Doduo, which appears fairly regularly.

<DODUO> - Rating: ****
He's actually a pretty decent Pokemon--high Attack and Speed, and Drill Peck is
a great move. Unfortunately, it's Dodrio's only worthwhile move. He's the best
of the bird Pokemon and certainly alright, but probably not too special now
that you've caught a few diverse Pokemon already.

Afterwards, head left into the upper section of the guardhouse and exit through
the left side. Trot on into the small, lonely house here and speak to its
occupant for the mightily useful <HM02> (Fly). Teach this to a useless bird
Pokemon ASAP, because it lets you instantly get to any previously visited major
section of Kanto i.e. the Towns and Cities. This saves a lot of time in
transportation. Head back to Celadon now.

Southwest of the Poke Center are two buildings we passed earlier. The left one
is the Game Corner and the right one is the Prize Exchange. Enter the Game
Corner and, as long as you have the Coin Case, you can start scrounging for
Coins here, which is different to money. There are a few hidden coins, as well
as stuff you can get by talking to people. Playing Yellow, here is what I
found. I might have missed some or it might be different in Red and Blue--
please let me know if you learn anything on this.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Coins  Where?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   10  Starting from the bottom left of the Game Corner, they're located one
       tile to the northeast of your current position.
   20  At the top is a Rocket. Two tiles south and two tiles east of him is the
       spot where these coins can be found.
   10  In the gap between the counter in the top left and the slots tables, one
       tile before the west wall.
  100  In the tile below the second bookcase in the top right corner.
   20  Given by the rightmost man in the Game Corner. He is wearing a hat.
   10  Hidden one tile to the southwest of said man.
   20  Given by the man to the left of the guy we just got Coins from.
   10  Hidden in the tile to the southwest of the bottommost guy in the Game
       Corner.
   20  One tile to the southeast of the woman in the second column of slots.
   10  One tile to the southeast of the man directly below her.
   20  One tile to the southeast of the topmost guy in the first column of
       slots.
   10  One tile southwest of the guy below him to the right, wearing a hat.
   10  Given by previous man.
   10  One tile to the southeast of the woman near him.
_______________________________________________________________________________

Total - 280 Coins.

I'm really not sure if these are fixed positions or even if they refresh, so
please let me know if you find out anything.

Anyway, you can play the slots by sitting on a seat and pressing A while facing
the wall next to you. I've got no hints for the slots since they're luck based
and differ by version. Essentially, you bet one, two or three coins and try to
line up Pokemon slots. Personally, I find it takes forever to get anywhere,
plus it's as boring as anything. The guy behind the counter will sell you Coins
at a rate of 50 Coins to every $1000. This is steep, but when you make oodles
of dosh from the Missingno. glitch later you won't even care.

Here's what you can get next door from the Prize Exchange:

Vulpix in Yellow and all the TMs for all versions.

<PORYGON> - Rating: *
It's trash with awful stats and it costs way to much to get. Use something
else, please.

Everything else can be gotten elsewhere, although you might want to get Scyther
and Pinsir here, since they'll be VERY difficult to catch otherwise. They live
in the Safari Zone, a hellhole which doesn't let you catch Pokemon normally.

<SCYTHER> - Rating: *
<PINSIR> - Rating: *
Unless you're rolling in cash, don't bother. These guys have fairly nice
physical stats, but only have non-STAB Normal moves to use it with, really.
Pinsir gets Submission, woop. Yeah, they're both kinda turds in this game.

Make sure you're healed up, then go to the Game Corner. Talk to the Rocket at
the back to engage in a fight!

He'll flee with his tail between his legs and you can check the poster he was
examining to find a secret switch. This opens a secret staircase to the right
into Team Rocket's lair. Before you go down, you might want to deposit some
items in the PC like I did, since you can only hold 20 different types of item
at any one time, and there's quite a few to nab down here (16, to be exact, but
they'll occupy 14 slots).

Confusion or Peck.
___

Snake down the path to the south and claim <TM10> (Double-Edge) once you get to
the end. Then check to the right of it for a hidden <NUGGET>, woop. Return to
the staircase, but don't go down it. Instead, head left into the first of two
spinner mazes, yay!

These irritating puzzles contain 'spinners', the arrow shaped tiles which
catapult you in their corresponding direction, and 'stoppers', which stop you
and allow you to move again if you have been ejected by a spinner. Walking over
a stopper does nothing.

So, enter the maze to the south and head down as far as you can without
touching any arrows. Take the downward-facing arrow and nab the <RARE CANDY> in
the alcove to the right. Take the upward-facing arrow just to your northwest,
then go up and around the wall until you come to an intersection of arrows, one
facing left and the other right. Take the left arrow, then head down into the
right-facing arrow. Take a zig-zag path left and down until you are blocked by
the south wall, then take the right-facing arrow that is second from the
bottom. Head left for another battle.

___

He'll drop the <LIFT KEY> afterwards which we direly need, although you'll have
to prompt him for it in Red and Blue. Shimmy around the table to collect <TM02>
(Razor Wind) as well.

Well, we have the Lift Key, so now all we need to do is find the lift.
To do this, first head back up the stairs you last took, then take
the arrows to the left. Go up, then up again, then walk on up and out of the
maze section. Take the flight of stairs, then head southwest into another maze.

Take the bottom of the two left-facing arrows, then grab the <MOON STONE> in
the little gap below you. Head back to the stopper, then head out to your
north, hugging the north wall and avoiding all the arrows, to get a <NUGGET>.
Head back to the same stopper, go down a tad and take the right arrow to pick
up <TM07> (Horn Drill). Head right, then down and step on to the right
downward-facing arrow.

Now take the left arrow. Head down the south path, take the bottom left arrow
and loop around the south pathway. Take the right upwards-facing arrow, then
grab the <SUPER POTION> tucked away here. Take the left arrow, then head north
and step on either arrow here. Take the right downward-facing arrow again, then
the left arrow again, and now take the southern path to the top of the two left
arrows. Step on the right-facing arrow just below you, then head farther into
the room, take the staircase here and battle the Rocket to your left.

_________________________________________________________

If you have a Grass or Water attack, which you should, then the first two pose
no problem--they're both incredibly slow, have poor Special stats and 4x
weaknesses to the aforementioned types. Kangaskhan might look intimidating, but
Comet Punch isn't too bad unless it hits four or five times, and the other two
moves suck a bit, unless Rage builds up, but you should have killed him by
then, especially if you have Submission.

Persian replaces Kanga in Yellow and is much faster at the cost of power. If
you get hit by Screech, your defense will plummet and you'll start taking
double, then triple, then quadruple damage each time he uses it. Switch out to
reset the effects. Otherwise, Persian's pretty easy since his defenses aren't
exactly top-notch.

Oh, and Giovanni has a stock of Guard Specs., which protects his Pokemon
against stat drops.
___

After being defeated, Giovanni will drop the <SILPH SCOPE>, which, although
unnecessary to complete the game, is a Key Item nonetheless. Snag it. Now get
back in the elevator and take it back to B1F. Upon emerging, you'll find one
last Rocket to destroy.

[ ] TM21 (Mega Drain)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 29

Okay, no messing around now--it's Gym time. But first, head to the PokeCenter,
heal up and deposit all your useless items in the PC. Also, take out a HM Slave
that knows Cut, because we'll need one to access the Gym.

Head to the southeast part of the city and use Cut on the tree here. Swing a
left, talk to the pervy old man if you wish, then head inside.

Erika and her cronies like to use Grass type Pokemon. Save for two Pokemon,
they all share a Poison typing as well, meaning Psychics will have fun here.
Also good are Ice, Fire and Flying types, although I doubt you'll have any Ice
moves that don't belong to a Water type, so that's out of the question.
Charizard will smoke this place out and Alakazam will also do pretty well. Here
is the team I had at this point.
___

My Team

Pikachu     L21 ~ ThunderShock, Thunder Wave, Quick Attack, Slam
Butterfree  L16 ~ Confusion, PoisonPowder, Stun Spore, Sleep Powder
Golem       L32 ~ Rock Throw, Mega Punch, Selfdestruct, Submission
Ivysaur     L31 ~ Tackle, Vine Whip, PoisonPowder, Razor Leaf
Alakazam    L34 ~ Teleport, Confusion, Psybeam, Recover

As you can see, Fearow has fallen out of favour, and Pikachu and Butterfree
just don't have the power to keep up anymore. Butterfree is only around for
status attacks on wild Pokemon, and Pikachu is, er, my starter. Alakazam owns
everything on the Special side, Golem on the Physical and Ivysaur hammers Rock,
Ground and Water types. I'm just using the three of those guys now.
___

There are seven trainers to take care of here, not including Erika herself.
Let's get started. Head on up to battle two women.

Be quick with whoever you're using (I'm using 'Zam, what a surprise) so that
you don't eat a ****load (truckload) of status effects. Wrap will severely

hit by any of these, trust me.

Alakazam's not so useful here, since Exeggcute is part Psychic itself. If you
have a Fire, Ice or Flying move, now would be the time to use it. Otherwise,
wail on it with strong neutral attacks. Hypnosis should be avoided and Reflect
only affects physical attacks (it halves them). Barrage is a weak multi-hit
move.
___

As you head right to face more trainers, you'll notice the second one along
doesn't come down to fight you. This is Erika, the Gym Leader. We'll smoke her
in a bit, but we might as well collect the juicy Exp. the other two lovely

_________________________________________________________

With high level Pokemon, two-thirds of whom sport Sleep Powder, Erika is going
to be pretty tough, although if you've been training well, she won't be the
toughest so far. Victreebel in R/B is a monster--at L29, Sleep Powder and Razor
Leaf in tandem is a deadly combo, and Wrap just makes it all the more annoying.
Thankfully, Charizard and Venusaur both take a quarter of the damage from Razor
Leaf, though Venusaur will be hard pressed to do any damage back. Alakazam can
turn it to pulp, as can a good Fire type, or perhaps Fearow?s Peck if you're
desperate. Or Drill Peck, if you have a L34 one.

Tangela's next up, but it's easy--L24, with two weak trapping moves. Tangela is
slow and has no physical presence, so you'll be fine. Finally, the L29
Vileplume. It too will hammer on Sleep Powder before using Petal Dance, a
deadly Grass move that will eventually confuse Vileplume. The confusion is a
nice touch, but hopefully you'll use your super-effective types to kill it by
then. Mega Drain shouldn't be too much to worry about either.

In Yellow, we again get a Tangela, but at L30, and with Vine Whip and Mega
Drain to work off its better Special stat. Thankfully, it's still slow, so any
decently fast Pokemon should nail it in one or two hits. Weepinbell and Gloom
are both about as powerful as their Red and Blue evolved counterparts
(Victreebel and Vileplume, respectively) due to their three extra levels, so
just use the advice I've handed out for those two above.

Erika occasionally uses a Super Potion on her Pokemon, which restores 50HP.
___

Congratulations! Once defeated, Erika will give you the RainbowBadge, which
means that traded Pokemon up to and including L50 will fully obey you. It also
gives you the ability to use the HM Strength on the field. She'll ALSO fork
over <TM21> (Mega Drain), a low power Grass move which absorbs half the
inflicted damage.

Our next destination is the Pokemon Tower, in Lavender Town. As preparation,
you will want either the Silph Scope, which you already have if you've followed
this guide, or a Poke Doll, which can be purchased from the Celadon Dept.
Store. You don't need both. However, regardless of which one you have, make
sure you get another Poke Doll to trade for a TM later, okay?

Let's go back to Lavender Town, but first, we'll take a small detour to get a
TM. Make sure you have a drink (either Fresh Water, Soda Pop or Lemonade in
your inventory--I advised people following this guide to buy a Fresh Water
earlier, so nab that from your PC if you deposited it. Now head east into Route
7, but, once you get there, instead of taking the Underground Path, enter the
guardhouse.
_______

Route 7
_______

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 31

Once you're in the guardhouse, if you have any of the aforementioned items, the
guard will automatically take it, allowing you entrance to Saffron City.
Saffron City lies at the heart of Kanto, providing quick access to Cerulean
City (north gatehouse), Lavender Town (east gatehouse), Vermilion City (south
gatehouse) and Celadon City (west gatehouse). Additionally, once you given any
of the four gatehouses' guards a drink, he'll share it with the other guards
and they will all allow you passage. Sweet!

____________

New Items
---------
[ ] TM29 (Psychic)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 31

If you mosey along the bottom row of houses, enter the only one with an
entrance (besides the Poke Center) and speak to the hat-clad man inside for
<TM29> (Psychic), one of the best moves in the game. Use it wisely. Team Rocket
have blocked off most of the fun aspects of Saffron City, so we'll come back
later--but there is one thing in which you can partake... if your levels are
high enough.

You'll be facing Fighting Pokemon exclusively, the highest of which are L37. So
if you have, say, a L32 or higher Psychic Pokemon, you should be okay. I'm
going to assume you don't, because otherwise this is a fairly hefty feat to
accomplish right now. But if you must, you can mosey on over to the north-east
side of Saffron and enter the left-most 'Gym'. Beat the five Fighting type
trainers inside and claim either Hitmonlee (recommended) or Hitmonchan (not so
much). I'll be covering this later in the guide, so don't sweat it if you think
you can't handle it yet.

To continue with your adventure, head over to the east gatehouse and follow
Route 8 east back to Lavender Town. Buy some Great Balls if you're running low
on Balls. On the east side of the town there is a large building--Pokemon
Tower. It's a Pokemon graveyard/memorial site, and regardless of how depressing
that it, we're going to have to venture inside as clear all the Rockets out of
there. Let's get started then, shall we?

If you choose not to traverse this area with the Silph Scope, you will not be
able to catch any wild Pokemon--they will appear as Ghosts and your Pokemon
will be too frightened to attack. Also, you need to defeat a very specific
Ghost at the end of the tower, so you'll need the Silph Scope--although it is
possible to get back that encounter by using a Poke Doll (purchased from
Celadon Poke Mart) instead. Still, I'd grab the Silph Scope, because otherwise
the wild Pokemon will remain unable to be caught.

Anyway, once you've healed up and entered the Tower, take the staircase to the
right to encounter your Rival again. I would show you my team, but it's the
same as when I last showed it, except my Alakazam is now L37. Fight time.

_________________________________________________________

*If you skipped the Route 22 Rival battle, the game considers the fight lost.

Your Rival is coming pretty close to having his final team of six. In Red and
Blue, he fights with a Grass/Fire/Water trio, topped off with Pidgeotto and
Kadabra. Pidgeotto is first, but its attacks deal little to no damage--the only
problem you should have is if it decides to spam Sand-Attack. In this case,
just switch out to reset your accuracy. Electric, Rock and Ice attacks work
best, any of which you could potentially have by now.

Next up are the two non-starters of the Grass/Fire/Water trio--that is, any two
of Exeggcute, Growlithe or Gyarados. Exeggcute is a pain with its Psychic
typing, but falls to a Fire, Flying or Ice attack. Barrage is weak, but
Hypnosis could get irritating. Growlithe has Bite and Ember, but these attacks
are fairly weak and any good Water, Rock or Ground type will make quick work of
him. Finally, Gyarados, the strongest of the three, has Thrash which works off
a powerful attack stat but confuses Gyarados after 2-3 turns. Luckily, if you
have an electric attack, Gyarados will faint due to its 4x weakness. Otherwise,
it's only weak to Rock type moves, so fire away with those since it has no
Water attacks to slam you with.

Next up is Kadabra, annoyingly weakness-free as always. Thankfully, it hasn't
got a powerful Psychic move yet--Confusion might cause, er, confusion, so
switch out if that happens. Disable is a pain, but since it's only one move at
a time, you should have backup moves to use. Hopefully, Kadabra will try to
Teleport to no effect a few times.

Finally, the starter. These guys are the same as always. Ivysaur only has one
damaging attack, but two status attacks in PoisonPowder and Leech Seed, which
can be annoying, so take it out with a Fire, Flying, Ice or Psychic attack
ASAP. Charmeleon is fairly easy to deal with as long as you aren't bothered by
Ember. It's also a good idea not to let him hit you too many times with Rage,
but he shouldn't be around long enough to build it up--Water, Rock or Ground
will sort him out. Wartortle has three damaging attacks, of which Water Gun is
its strongest. A good Grass or Electric will sort him out, but just wail on him
with strong attacks from anything that isn't Fire, Rock or Ground if you
haven't got any Grass or Electric types.

In Yellow, your Rival works off a Fire/Water/Electric core, packing two of
those three types now and later evolving Eevee into the third. First up,
though, is Fearow, whose Fury Attack can be annoying. Interestingly, Fearow
packs Mirror Move, which copies your last move and uses it against you--some
planning ahead might be required so you don't get your Gyarados to use
Thunderbolt, for example. Anyway, Fearow chokes on Electric, Rock and Ice
attacks.

Then you'll face two of Vulpix, Shellder or Magnemite. Vulpix has Quick Attack
and Ember--no problem for a hardened Water, Rock or Ground type. It also packs
the useless Roar. Hope it spams that. Next up, Shellder has Supersonic to
confuse you and Clamp to trap you--things will get irritating if you don't
faint it with a fast Grass or Electric type. Maybe, if you lost one of your
first Rival battles, you'll face Magnemite. SonicBoom will be very annoying,
but just use Ground type moves or, failing that, the strongest thing you have.
Like a L37 Alakazam.

Last up is Eevee. Quick Attack is surprisingly decent, but that's all it has
apart from status attacks. Sand-Attack might get annoying as always, so if your
accuracy drops below comfortable levels, switch out to reset the effect. Eevee
shouldn't be too bad, especially if you own something that packs Submission or
is a Rock type (Golem).

Oh, and when his Pokemon are at low health, he likes to use a Potion. This
won't heal much of their HP though, maybe about 1/3rd of their HP bar. So yeah.

Phew.
___

Head up to the third floor by taking the stairs on the west. On this floor,
wild Pokemon will start appearing, which you cannot see or fight unless you
have the Silph Scope. Time to start catching.

<GASTLY> - Rating: *** (Haunter)
         - Rating: **** (Gengar)
Gastly and its evolution, Haunter, are the only evolution line in the game that
is Ghost type. This means that they are immune to Normal and Fighting attacks.
However, they are part Poison and, thanks to a glitch in RBY, Ghost type moves
cannot harm Psychic types. Still, they learn a nice variety of moves and are
immune to any Pokemon that just packs Normal moves. It also packs some awesome
Special and Speed stats.

You'll be fighting plenty of Ghosts soon, so you can use your Psychic type (who
should be a staple team member) to obliterate them. Ground type moves also do
well. Ghost itself as a type is only weak to the pathetic and rare Ghost type
attacks, so I?d just hammer their Poison weakness instead.

You can also catch a Cubone and I would recommend catching two for Yellow
players, who can trade one for a Machoke (which will instantly evolve into
Machamp, since Machoke's evolution criterion is to be traded).

<CUBONE> - Rating: *
Cubone itself is a fairly bad Pokemon, overshadowed by much better Ground types
and just a tad too low-levelled to be useful in a team right now. It's got poor
or average stats besides Defense, which doesn't count for too much really. But
hey, if you think he's adorable and must have one, be my guest.

Note that for the Channelers, I will not be providing any strategy--they all
use the same Pokemon. Use Psychic or Ground moves for the best effect, and know
that Gastly and Haunter have high Special stats, so if you can only manage to
hit them neutrally, physical attacks will deal more damage.

First, head north and around to east on this floor and take on the Channeler
here.

be taken out by Grass, Water or Ice attacks. No, it can't be caught, even by
the Master Ball. If, for some reason, you don't have the Silph Scope, use the
Poke Doll item to appease the spirit. Either way, take the stairs afterwards.

Now, Red and Blue players will have to fight past three Rockets here.

New Items
---------
[ ] Poke Flute

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 33

Head up on inside Mr. Fuji's house and talk to him to receive the <POKE FLUTE>.
This fantastic item will let you wake up the two pesky Snorlax you might have
seen lying around, and then battle them to either catch or faint them. Either
way, they'll be removed from the map so your path is no longer blocked. The
Poke Flute also acts like an infinite-use Awakening, in that it wakes your
Pokemon up in one turn, so it is well worth hanging on to. However, should the
opponent be asleep as well, they will also wake up if you use the Flute.
_______

Route 5
_______

New Pokemon
-----------
( ) Machoke (Y)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 33

Now that you have a Cubone (or two, if you wanted a spare), if you would like
to trade it for a Machoke that evolves instantly into Machamp, take the Cubone
out of your PC and head on over to Saffron City. Take the north exit out of the
guardhouse, then take an immediate right and enter the small house here at the
bottom of Route 5, the one that leads to the underground path. Talk to the girl
here to initiate the trade to get a very cool Machamp.

You now have a few choices: you can clear out Silph Co., a tower full of
Rockets (again, but much harder this time) in Saffron City; you can take Routes
12-15 all the way to Fuchsia City, earning a truckload of Exp. and the Super
Rod along the way; or you can take Cycling Road--Routes 16-18--to Fuchsia City
also. Of the three options, the last one is the easiest, so I'm going to do
that first, followed by Routes 12-15, and finally Silph Co. Okay?

Head to Celadon City now, and leave via its western exit.

[ ] Snorlax

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 33

If you don't already have Fly, Cut the tree above you, follow the path to a
house, and talk to the occupant inside. Done. The first obstacle of the Route
is, of course, Snorlax. To wake him up and battle him, use the Poke Flute while
standing next to him. You can catch or faint him--either way, he'll disappear
for good so you can proceed. However, there are only two Snorlax in this game,
so you might want to catch him. If you use my strategy below, it'll take you,
on average, about four Great Balls. Save beforehand!

#143: Snorlax     NRM        L30   660 Exp.
 ~ Headbutt, Amnesia, Rest
_________________________________________________________

I didn't provide Snorlax's stats here--they're randomised (to a certain extent)
because he's a wild Pokemon.

Here's the plan if you want to catch him--have some Great Balls handy, or if
you have any Ultra Balls you're welcome to use those. If you use a Great Ball,
your optimum chances of catching Snorlax is at below half of its HP--there's no
need to go any lower than that, because it doesn't improve your chances. With
an Ultra Ball, you'll need to get him below a third of his HP before any more
HP damage becomes redundant. Now, play around with him until he uses Rest
(which fully heals him but gives him Sleep status), then quickly get him into
the required low HP range, because he'll wake up two turns after he uses it.

At these ranges (1/3 for Ultra, 1/2 for Great), and with Sleep status in
effect, your chances for catching Snorlax are at their maximum, with a ~24.88%
chance with a Great Ball (average four tries), and a ~33.11% chance with an
Ultra Ball (average three tries). There is no possible way for that chance to
get any higher, short of using a Master Ball. Just keep tossing Balls, and
you'll eventually come out on top! By the way, the most damaging move you can
do to Snorlax is probably Submission, but I wouldn't recommend it since his HP
stat is huge so you'll get mega recoil damage.
___

<SNORLAX> - Rating: ****
Arriving at L30 with a STAB move, a recovery move, and a stat-boosting move,
Snorlax is a fine team addition that slots in very nicely. He also has no
weaknesses--apart from the rarely-used Fighting type--a behemoth HP and very
nice Attack stat. The only thing that holds him back is his Slow rate of
growth, meaning he takes forever to level up. It's up to you if you think he's
worth it or not.

Continue west into Route 16, but note that without a Bicycle this is as far as
you get. You can find out how to get a Bicycle by reading the Vermilion City
section, if you haven't been following this guide.

<PONYTA (Y)> - Rating: **
Now that you're in this grass patch, you might as well catch yourself a Ponyta,
if you're playing Yellow version anyway. Unfortunately, despite its
awesomeness, Ponyta is nigh unusable in-game, because it doesn't get any decent
Fire moves and it evolves at L40. I'd give it a miss.

Also, while you're here, you should search for a hidden <RARE CANDY> in the
grass here. It lies in the grass patch, seven rows down and three columns in
from the right, but manoeuvring there will be a pain because of the hill
automatically making you cycle south all the time. Just spam the A button while
traversing the third column in from the right and you should get it.

Take a left from the trainers you just beat to fight another Trainer.

Switching Pokemon around in these battles will help keep your party at decent
balanced levels. Otherwise, your Psychic Pokemon will be far too overpowered on
this Route. Weezing offers a lot of Exp., so start with him.

centre one is another Biker.

Annoying, but not dangerous. Use a fast Psychic type. If you can't, Poison Gas
always poisons and disable will probably cripple your favourite move. Still,
his damaging attack is lame and so he'll have a hard time beating you.
___

Continue down the narrow middle pathway until you get to sign. The sign
mentions 'discarded items'. I think I'll get one of those now, thanks. If you
travel up against the left edge of this centre path, about six paces up is a
hidden <FULL RESTORE>. Again, spam A to get it while moving.

Take the left path now and just kill the two trainers along here. You've seen
all the Pokemon before--hundreds of times--so no strategies for you.

_________________________________________________________

After you beat this guy, ride down so that you are just above the middle short
fence, and position yourself just above the very left edge of this fence. A
couple of steps above here is a hidden <MAX ELIXER>. Afterwards, head down.
When you stop moving downhill automatically, then you know that you've reached
the end of this annoying Route.

Woo. Head east through the guardhouse. On the top floor, a dude will trade you
Lickitung in Red/Blue, which is great, because that's the only one this game
offers. Fab. Unfortunately, we don't have Slowbro, so I'll have to remind you
to come back. In Yellow, he offers Parasect for Tangela, which isn't a good
trade. Besides, we don't have Tangela yet. I'll remind you to get a spare,
though, if you must trade.

Exit the station. To your east lies Fuchsia City, which you are welcome to
explore. Find the Poke Center if you want (take the very first south path--one
tile wide--to get there), but then come back here. Just after the exit of the
guardhouse, to the south, are two more trainers and this area's wild Pokemon...
of which none should be new to you. Juicy Exp. time it is then! In order, I'm
tackling the guy on the left, then the two below him.

All of these guys can be taken down by Electric, Ice or Rock attacks. Take your
pick. Drill Peck is the most dangerous move here, but only Dodrio uses it to
its full potential. Dodrio is easily the hardest one here, but it can't
penetrate Golem's shell. Anything not Grass, Bug or Fighting should do well
here.

That is literally it for Route 18, unless you happen not to have caught all the
available Pokemon here. Head east into Fuchsia City.

After healing at the Poke Center, head east over the ledge. On your right are
two houses, but the one that interests us is the one on the right. Inside is
the Fishing Guru's brother, who will fork over the <GOOD ROD>, and if you head
out the back door, you can practice with it in the pond here. Up for grabs are:

<GOLDEEN> - Rating: **
A thouroughly awful Water Pokemon that I wouldn't waste my time with. Honestly.
Okay so it's not THAT bad, but it is still pretty poor.

<POLIWAG> - Rating: ***
A not-so-awful Pokemon that happens to have average stats and an unfortunate
weakness to Psychic types upon its final evolution. A bit too low-levelled to
really be worth your investment here, but has a wide movepool and useful
typing. Catch an extra one and go back to Cerulean City to trade it for a Jynx!

<JYNX> - Rating: ****
Despite only possessing average-at-best stats, Jynx is a great Pokemon which
boasts two powerful STAB moves in Ice Beam and Psychic, if you can spare the
TMs. Boosted EXP. points is always a plus too.

If you feel up to it, you can challenge the Gym Leader, Koga, right now.
Considering he uses a L43 in Red/Blue and a L50 in Yellow, you might, like me,
bit a bit under-levelled. I'm going to wait. But trust me, the Gym is the least
exciting thing in Fuchsia compared to the Safari Zone.

Yes, we're here. If you don't already know, the Safari Zone is a haven full of
Pokemon, a wild outback where, for a measly $500, you're given 30 Safari Balls
and a 500 step counter to catch whatever you want. Of course, that sounds too
good to be true... because it is.

You don't fight the wild Pokemon like normal--rather, you have to pelt them
with rocks and bait enough to catch them. Totally not animal cruelty or
anything. And they have a chance in any given turn to run away from you. So
yes, it's very annoying, especially since some of the rarest Pokemon appear
here, with ridiculously low encounter rates. But if you persist, you can come
home with a truckload of exotic 'Mons, most of which cannot be caught
elsewhere.

However, there is, in Red and Blue at least, a way to catch Safari Pokemon
using the traditional 'beat-them-til-they're-nearly-dead-then-toss-a-Ball-at-
them' method, but we'll have to wait until we reach Cinnabar Island for that.
If the Safari Zone gets on your nerves like it does mine, feel free to wait.
I'll remind you of the glitch (and another infamous one) once we reach
Cinnabar.

There are a lot of Pokemon to catch, so consider changing to an empty box in
your PC. There are also a bunch of items, so consider emptying them into your
PC as well. Even if you don't want to catch any Pokemon, the Safari Zone is
still a mandatory part of your quest, since there are a few quest-related items
contained within.

Anyway, to get to the fabled Safari Zone, snake your way to the very north
point of Fuchsia City--made easier if you are holding a Cut-user--then enter
the building here and agree to take part. Awesome.

Catching Pokemon here is a pain, especially since they're so damn rare, and the
chance of catching something like Scyther is about 10% if you don't throw rocks
or bait at it. Speaking of which, the catch system here gives you four options.
Very roughly, this is what happens:
- Run: You can escape from any battle with 100% success.
- Throw Rock: Doubles capture chance and doubles chance of foe running.
- Throw Bait: Halves capture chance and quarters chance of foe running.
- Throw Ball: Attempts a catch.
You can stack these effects, so two thrown rocks would quadruple the capture
chance and the chance to run. This really isn't recommended, because the
absolute highest chance you have of catching a Pokemon is ~=33.59% (because
they always have full HP, your chances are significantly lowered), but a
quadruple chance of running away means you'll never get to see them. If you're
interested in the 100% accurate version of this, check out section M09; 'Safari
Zone Catching Mechanics'. Also note that the faster a Pokemon is, the higher
its chance of escaping. Trust me when I say your best bet is to just lob Safari
Balls.

Also, the Safari Zone gives you a limited number of steps--500 to be exact.
Once you have taken 500 steps, you are automatically recalled to the reception
area. You can also resign by returning to the entrance. When you quit the
Safari Zone, all unused Safari Balls will be lost. If you want to catch Pokemon
without fear of being recalled, you can rotate on the spot (in tall grass,
obviously) by pressing the D-Pad very lightly, which doesn't count towards the
step counter.

Oh, and there are no trainers here, which is great. Okay, let's get started.

The first area, the Entrance, has nothing of interest at the moment, except
patches of grass where you can start catching your 'Mons. New Pokemon include:

<VENONAT> - Rating: *
Venonat is new for Red and Blue players, but it's worse than it's Yellow
counterpart and is stuck with amazing moves like TACKLE and LEECH LIFE
(sarcasm) for a long time. Skip it, honestly.

<EXEGGCUTE> - Rating: ***
A Grass/Psychic hybrid that relies heavily on TMs for moves--it does at least
get some nice early support in Hypnosis and can be evolved whenever you feel
like it with the Leaf Stone. It also has a fantastic Special stat, but you
should make sure to use the Psychic TM from Saffron to unleash its full
potential.

<RHYHORN> - Rating: **
A decent Ground/Rock type a bit similar to Golem, but who arrives too late and
requires too many TMs to be useful compared to, say, Dugtrio.

<CHANSEY> - Rating: **
The premier Special sponge has a few difficulties attacking with her natural
movepool, but give her a few Special TMs and she might fare okay for you. Keep
her away from physical Pokemon!

<TANGELA> - Rating: *
For Yellow players, a bulky Grass type that just can't compete with the likes
of Victreebel and Venusaur since it lacks Razor Leaf.

If you want to complete all in-game trades, Red and Blue players should catch a
Nidorino (to trade for Nidorina in Route 11) and Yellow players should catch a
Tangela (to trade for Parasect in Route 18).

Head east down a narrow path into some grass. Here you can find...

<KANGASKHAN> - Rating: **
A decent but not-that-special Normal type sweeper, very much outclassed by...

<TAUROS> - Rating: ***
One of the game's premier physical powerhouses--with top notch Attack and Speed
stats. Needs a crapton of TMs to be anywhere near useful though.

Climb up the stairs here and continue north for a tasty <CARBOS>. Go slightly
down, then west past the stairs you just ascended, and take the other set of
stairs down here. Follow the path around, hugging the water's edge, to come
across <TM37> (Egg Bomb). Exit this little alcove and head northwest for a <MAX
POTION>. Then head east, up the stairs on to a little raised section before
coming back down the other side. Pick up the <FULL RESTORE> in plain sight
here, then head north past the Rest House and west, taking the lower of the two
branching pathways, into Area 2.

Head west into the giant patch of grass, ignoring the first set of steps here--
they will lead you on a winding route that leads to an empty, step-consuming
dead end. Also ignore the south pathway, which leads to a dead end full of
grass back in Area 1. In the giant grass patch, head north up the stairs and
follow the route until you come to an intersection by a pond. Head north until
you cannot do so anymore, then head east for <TM40> (Skull Bash). Head east,
then loop around on yourself, heading north past the Rest House, and start
going west for a <PROTEIN>. Continue west, then head to the southwest portion
of this open area, then down a south pathway to access Area 3.

Head down and pick up the <GOLD TEETH>, then head west for <TM32> (Double
Team). Check the bottom of the two statues to the right of the Secret House
here for a hidden <REVIVE>, then enter this house and talk to its resident for
the fantastic <HM03> (Surf). Not only does this let you traverse water--
provided you have the SoulBadge--but it is also arguably the best Water type
move in the game. If you have any Water types, I'm hard pressed to find one who
wouldn't benefit from this great move.

That's all we can do here for the moment, unless you already have the SoulBadge
or the Super Rod, but I haven't got those items in the guide yet, so we'll come
back later. Let your step counter run out to return to Fuchsia City.

Fuchsia City

New Items
---------
[ ] HM04 (Strength)  [ ] Rare Candy

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 36

Do you remember where you got the Good Rod, to the east of the Poke Center?
Enter the house to the left of that one and, if you have the Gold Teeth, talk
to the warden who will give you the game's last HM, <HM04> (Strength), which
gives you the ability to move boulders on the field. It's also a decent Normal
type move, but since you can't delete HMs without trading to GSC and back, make
sure that you don't mind it on your Pokemon--there are better Normal moves out
there. You need the RainbowBadge to use Strength--luckily, we already have it,
so go ahead and push the boulder to your right aside for a <RARE CANDY>.

Apart from the Gym, and a few things I mentioned before about the Safari Zone,
we've done everything in Fuchsia City. If you feel underlevelled for the Gym, I
do have a remedy--four Routes stuffed with trainers: Routes 12-15. They
represent the 'other' way into Fuchsia, and lead from Lavender southwards. Fly
to Lavender now, then head south out of the town. I'd highly recommend keeping
your Fly user with you, since there are a ****load (boatload) of trainers to
fight down these Routes. Oh, and bring your Poke Flute, because there's another
Snorlax to catch/faint.

Head south down the wooden path, then take a right at the fork and continue
south into the guardhouse. Talk to the woman upstairs for TM39 if you didn't
grab it while in Lavender Town, then leave through the south exit. Go east at
the next fork and follow the path to a trainer. Oh, and I won't be providing
battle strategies for the next four Routes--the Pokemon are all much lower
levels than you and you should have a pretty good idea of type advantage at
this point. Also, I'm lazy.

its HP (or half if you're using a Great Ball), then chuck a Ball at it until
you catch it.

Continue heading south along a winding path to another trainer. Since we've
passed the Snorlax, the levels of enemy Pokemon will jump up a bit, but not
enough to pose much of a threat.

Enter the house and speak to the final Fishing Guru brother for the best rod in
the game; the <SUPER ROD>. You can head outside and start fishing immediately
for three average Water types that are outclassed by much better Pokemon:

<TENTACOOL> - Rating: ***
Tentacool has the unfortunate Poison typing, but a lovely 120 Special stat.
Water types are pretty much always useful, and he can use Wrap as well if
you're feeling cheap.

<KRABBY> - Rating: **
A generic Water type that can't use STAB attacks very well due to having a very
low Special stat. Cry.

<HORSEA> - Rating: ***
Another generic Water type, but at least this one has a good Special stat.

Keep following the path after you're done and you'll soon chance across a Cut-
able tree. Hack it down and fight the guy inside.

Continue southwards. Once you find another Cut-able tree, you can hack your way
into a grassy area--this Route's wild Pokemon reside only here. Yellow players
can bag themselves the thoroughly useless Farfetch'd and, er, that's about it
for new Pokemon, unless you count evolutions. Once you're done, cut your way
back out and head south, eventually passing into the next Route... But first,
you can Fly around Kanto and test out your new Super Rod, bagging a whole bunch
of Pokemon.

<PSYDUCK> - Rating: ***
<SLOWPOKE> - Rating: **
<SHELLDER> - Rating: **
<STARYU> - Rating: ****
Psyduck, Slowpoke and Shellder haven't been evaluated yet, but are all sort of
average Water types at this point of the game. Psyduck is average across the
board, Slowpoke is bulky and Psychic but hideously slow, and Shellder is
heavily defensive and generally pretty decent when attacking. The only shining
star here (pun thouroughly intended) is Staryu, who eventually evolves into the
powerful, speedy, versatile, Water/Psychic Starmie, a fantastic Pokemon to
have. Unfortunately, it's too low levelled now to be of much use, but a tiny
bit of grinding can sort that right out.

We're also going to head over to the Safari Zone again, but I'm going to wait
until we get the SoulBadge too, so that we can totally finish it all in one go.
Of course, if you must have Dratini now, then go ahead. Anyway, once you're
done, return to where we left off from in Route 12, then head south into Route
13.

Head west into a maze-like area. Follow the bottom path west, hugging the south
wall, then tuck yourself intoa tiny alcove and face left, pressing A to uncover
a hidden <CALCIUM>. Head back to the entrance to the maze area, then take the
upper pathway to find two Beauties. I'll tackle the right one first.

If you want to--and provided you have a Cut-user--you can head a little west
from her, then zig-zag to your northeast to find a Cut-able tree, which leads
to this Route's tall grass, where Red/Blue players can catch Ditto.

<DITTO> - Rating: *
A novelty Pokemon that is essentially useless, but can Transform into the
opposing Pokemon, with all their stats (except HP) and moves (at 5PP each). Fun
to play with, but not a serious contender. Also, he appears here very rarely;
very soon in Route 15 he has a 20% appearance rate, so consider waiting just a
tad.

From the Jr. Trainer you last defeated, head all the way west until you are
challenged by a Bird Keeper.

Head west from this guy, tuck yourself into another alcove and, facing down,
press A to nab a <PP UP>. Now, zig-zag northeast like you were going to the
tall grass area again. To the west of this area, along the north wall, is
another Bird Keeper to fight.

south path, both west into Route 15. We'll want to take both eventually, but
I'd recommend starting with the top pathway.

After you've done all that, congratulate yourself, for you have just taken out
a huge amount of trainers. Head west into the gatehouse, then head upstairs.
Talk to the Professor's aide and he'll evaluate your 'Dex--if you have 50 or
more Pokemon, he'll give you the <EXP. ALL>, an item which shares earned Exp.
with every non-fainted member of your party. Usually not worth hanging on to,
unless you're training up some low level Pokemon.

Okay, exit west into Fuchsia. We'll swipe the SoulBadge off Koga, then finish
up some business in the Safari Zone.
____________

[ ] TM06 (Toxic)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 41

First and foremost, get to the Poke Center. Once you've done that, trudge west
into Koga's Gym. Hopefully your Pokemon are in their low 40's at this point.
Koga's highest level Pokemon is L43 in Red/Blue and L50 in Yellow. Don't let
that L50 put you off--it's a fairly weak Bug/Poison type, so any decent Fire,
Flying, Rock or Psychic type will bring it down with ease. Koga and his cronies
all use the Poison type. Yeah. How this guy became a Gym Leader, I'll never
know. Anyway, this is what I was using at this point:
___

My Team

Golem       L43 ~ Rock Throw, Submission, Earthquake, Explosion
Venusaur    L40 ~ Tackle, Vine Whip, PoisonPowder, Razor Leaf
Alakazam    L44 ~ Psybeam, Recover, Reflect, Psychic

Honestly, just these three guys were enough to blitz through most of the game
so far. Pikachu was only really necessary for the early portions of the game--
he took care of Flying and Water types, which are now taken care of by Golem
and Venusaur respectively. Butterfree is useless now except for laying down
Sleep Powder. Hm. I'll be getting myself an awesome new Electric type Pokemon
in the next section.

I'm aware that not everyone can have these team members up until this point, so
here's a few things I recommend in preparation for the Elite Four--the game's
penultimate challenge:

- An Electric type Pokemon with Thunderbolt or at least Thunder.
- A Grass or Water Pokemon, with Razor Leaf or Surf respectively.
- A Psychic Pokemon packing Psychic.
- A Ground type Pokemon packing Earthquake or Dig.
- A physical Pokemon with a Rock and/or Fighting attack (Rock Slide /
  Submission).
- A Pokemon packing Blizzard or Ice Beam.

I'm going to get myself a Zapdos to satisfy the first criterion, but Jolteon or
Raichu work just as well. Then I have Venusaur (otherwise maybe Victreebell?
For Water types most things work well), Alakazam (try Hypno otherwise), Golem
for criteria 4 and 5, and I'll net myself an Articuno for the last criterion.
Job done.
___

Once you're in the Gym, you might start to notice that there are invisble walls
blocking the path to Koga. Apparently you can only make them out (vaguely) on
colour screen Game Boys, so I'll point you in the right direction, in case
you're still playing on a machine from the Stone Age.

First, take on the trainer to the left of the Gym.

Somebody clearly didn't get the memo about Poison type Pokemon. Yes, it's our
old enemy, the Psychic type. The best you can do is use a powerful physical
move to slam these guys on their weaker defensive side. Jugglers like to switch
their Pokemon out every so often--strangely, it occurs relative to the Speed
stat of the Pokemon they currently have in play (usually, a switch ALWAYS goes
first in a turn). This actually helps you, so don't get scared.

He has totally different teams depending on your version, as you can see. First
up, Red and Blue. Koffing and Muk you've seen before and shouldn't have any
problems with, as long as you stick to Ground and Psychic types.

A L43 Weezing is his toughest Pokemon... but it likes to Selfdestruct a lot.
Bring in something with high Defense that resists all its moves (Golem) and
it'll kill itself for you. Thanks! If it doesn't, it might try to Toxic you,
which saps 1/16th health on your first turn, then 2/16ths, then 3/16ths... etc.
If you switch out, it reverts to normal poison at 1/16th a turn. So yeah, you
can totally wipe out Koga's strategy by switching. Nice and easy.

For Yellow players, don't be upset that his Pokemon are about seven levels
higher--they make up for it by being, erm, awful. Venonat will try to annoy you
with staus, but you should honestly be fast enough and powerful enough to be
unfazed by it. Use the Poke Flute if Sleep strikes!

His strongest member is a L50 Venomoth. Try to take it out quickly, since
Double Team is infuriating to get past (since it raises Evade) if he spams it a
lot. Leech Life is nothing serious, Toxic can be dealt with by switching out
and Psychic can hurt--although it doesn't get STAB so it's not as powerful as
it could be. Rock, Flying, Fire and Psychic types fare well against this guy.

In both versions, Koga likes to buff his Pokemon up with X Attack. Hopefully,
you'll have defeated him before he gets the chance to use too many.
___

When all is said and done, you'll be rewarded with oodles of dosh, the
SoulBadge and the near-useless <TM06> (Toxic). The badge ups your Pokemons'
Defense stats (sweet) and, best of all, allows you to use Surf outside of
battle. And yes, we are going to be abusing this fact for the rest of the game.

Now that you have Surf, almost all of the map is available to explore. Those of
you who are keen to get infinite supplies of all the items you can think of by
exploting a glitch should check out section C05; 'The Missingno. Glitch', since
Cinnabar Island is now available to you (Surf south from Pewter City).
Unfortunately, Yellow players cannot take advantage of this glitch. Sad face.

Those of you who are playing legitimately (good for you!) are welcome to join
me on a roundup of all things Surf-related. But first, head back to the Safari
Zone. Bring your Super Rod and a Surf-user.
___________

Safari Zone
___________

New Items
---------
[ ] Nugget  [ ] Max Revive  [ ] Max Potion

New Pokemon
-----------
[ ] Dratini

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 42

From the entrance, head north and Surf across to a little island to pick up a
<NUGGET>. Surf west and take the exit here, then head farther west to pick up a
<MAX REVIVE> in the corner here. Head up the stairs next to it and follow them
west to a <MAX POTION> in the grassy area here.

This area is also the wild Pokemon set for Area 3 of the Safari Zone, so get
catching if you need anything. Head west, then north past the raised section of
land and you'll get to some water. Whip out your Super Rod and fish for a
Dratini.

<DRATINI> - Rating: **
The game's only Dragon type and a decent fighter... if you can invest
truckloads of time into it. And I mean truckloads, since it's basically trash
until it evolves into Dragonite at L55. Yeesh.

Once you're done, run out your step counter to exit the Safari Zone.

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 42

- Route 6:
<PSYDUCK (Y)> - Rating: **
By Surfing on the water in Route 6, Yellow players can nab themselves a
Psyduck. Red and Blue players should have already got one. Thoroughly average
for a Water type, but really unusable due to his low level of arrival, at about
L15.

- Vermilion City:
Head to the house northeast of the Gym. Get into the water on its west side,
then examine the wall immediately to your right as you enter the water for a
<MAX ETHER>.

- Celadon City:
In the centre of the city is a small pond, which you can Surf across. The man
on the other side will give you <TM41> (Softboiled) for your trouble.

- Route 12:
Not long after you enter its northern terminus (come south from Lavender Town),
you'll see an item ball on an island out to the east. Surf out and grab <TM16>
(Pay Day).

- Route 13:
By Surfing this Route, Yellow players can obtain Slowpoke or its evolution,
Slowbro. I've evaluated it before for Red/Blue players--It's reeaaaaally slow
though, so despite Water/Psychic being a really useful type it's mostly
outclassed by the other Water types.

Now that we're done, we're going to do something pretty cool (but also totally
optional). If you want a L50 Electric type legendary Pokemon for your party, as
well as a few cool Electric types to boot, read on. Make sure that you've
supplied yourself with a bunch of Ultra Balls (available at Fuchsia) because
this is going to be difficult. So difficult, in fact, that without any status
effects in play, the best chance you have of catching Zapdos is less than 2%.
So bring something with Sleep or Freeze or, failing that, at least one of the
other status effects.

You might also want to deposit any non-essential items in the PC. Fly to
Cerulean City, then get out a Cut-user and a Surf-user. Exit to the east side
of town (remember, you have to go through the burgled house first). Cut the
tree and head into Route 9, heading all the way east until you finally end up
in a big grass patch surrounded by water--you will now be in Route 10.
________

Route 10
________

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 42

Enter the water using Surf. There are no Pokemon within, so relax. Go east,
then just follow the path all the way around until you reach dry land. There is
a lone trainer here.

I'll quickly outline the Pokemon you can catch here. I've evaluated Magnemite
and Voltorb before, but the rest might be new to you:

Magnemite is a slow, powerful Pokemon with no movepool, totally outclassed by
many other Electric types in this area. Voltorb is the opposite: Fast but weak.
Again, it has no real moves to speak of outside of sacrificing the Thunderbolt
TM on it, and outside of its Speed it's pretty average.

<GRIMER> - Rating: *
Grimer is the same, only Poison type and Yellow-exclusive (for now). It's
pretty trashy overall, with a horrible movepool and bad typing making it
impossible to recommend. Sorry.

<ELECTABUZZ> - Rating: ***
Electabuzz is available only to Red players. Yeah, he's... okay, but there is a
MUCH better Electric type coming up. Can't deny that the 'Buzz is cool though.

Head north through the first room, then take the <CARBOS> in the alcove
immediately to your right. Continue to follow the path until you come to an
intersection. On your left is something that looks like an item ball, but is in
reality a L40 Voltorb.

#100: Voltorb     ELE        L40   588 Exp.
 ~ SonicBoom, Selfdestruct, Light Screen, Swift
_________________________________________________________

Afterwards, head right down a long corridor, then head up an take the item--
actually a Voltorb--here in the little alcove. Then continue to follow the
path, taking down the L43 Electrode in your path.
_________________________________________________________
Fake item ball: Electrode                Version: R  B  Y
---------------------------------------------------------
#101: Electrode   ELE        L43   921 Exp.
 ~ SonicBoom, Selfdestruct, Light Screen, Swift
_________________________________________________________

Once you've defeated him, continue to follow the pathway right up until a dead
end. Face the west wall and press A to reveal a hidden <MAX ELIXER>. That's all
there is in this room, so head back to the intersection where you fainted your
first fake item ball Voltorb. Head all the way south until you hit to
southernmost wall, then head right. The top item is <TM33> (Reflect) and the
one to the right is a Voltorb.

Exit this room to the northwest and take an immediate right. The next two items
you'll pass are Voltorbs. Take the next south path you come across and take the
item on your left for <TM25> (Thunder). The item to the right is another
Voltorb. Head back out and continue east, then follow the path around until you
reach a small opening to the north. Take it, then take the small left path to a
<HP UP> and the right path to a <RARE CANDY>. Sweet. Exit this little room and
continue west.

Follow the path around until you see an item ball--really an Electrode--in the
tiny room to the south. Battle it if you wish, but ultimately head west and
follow the path north. At the northeast part of this room, wedge yourself into
the alcove, face the north wall and prise out a hidden <PP UP>. Head left, then
go down and you'll see a bird on the map. DO NOT ENGAGE IT WITHOUT SAVING
FIRST! This is Zapdos, a L50 Electric/Flying type legendary. It is immensely
powerful and difficult to catch, so prepare yourself, save your game, and
approach it.

#145: Zapdos      ELE / FLY  L50  1542 Exp.
 ~ ThunderShock, Drill Peck
_________________________________________________________

Oh yeah. Make absolutely sure that you status it, because this is otherwise
next to impossible. Honestly. Golem resists all its moves, so slap some status
on it and then switch in something that can handle its moves. Then lob Ultra
Balls at it.

Yup, you heard me--don't bother chipping away at his HP. Even if you get in the
magical zone--below a 1/3rd of Max HP--the chance will only increase by a tiny
percentage. Yeah. Check out the Mechanics section of this guide--M07; 'Catch
Rate Formula' if you don't believe me. Just get him statused, then lob Ultra
Balls at him. He'll be caught eventually... and quicker than you might expect.
Slap PSN/PAR/BRN on him and you have an ~8.6% chance (with an Ultra Ball) at
full HP. SLP/FRZ give you a ~17.2% chance at full HP. So you'll get there in
the end.
___

<ZAPDOS> - Rating: *****
Well, I don't know about you, but he's becoming part of my team. Between
Thunderbolt and Drill Peck, Zapdos will pose a massive problem to anything that
isn't a Rock/Ground type. A beautiful stat distribution and very nice typing
are also massive bonuses.

Exit to your left to miraculously exit the way you came in. And yes, if you go
back in, you'll begin at the entrance. Weird. Whoever designed the blueprints
for this place must have come from a different dimension. Anyway, next
destination is Saffron City. If you don't have a Fly-user with you (probably
best not to teach Zapdos Fly), then head south along Route 10 until you find a
Poke Center outside Rock Tunnel.

You should now be more than sufficiently levelled to take on the Fighting

providing any strategies--you should be able to breeze through, especially if
you have a Psychic type. Even if you don't, Zapdos's Drill Peck will take care
of them all. Head to the northeast of the city and enter the smaller Gym to the

Once you beat the Gym's 'leader', you'll get a choice between either Hitmonlee
(on the left) or Hitmonchan. They come at L30, which is a little too low to be
useful now. But still, if you must have one for your team, Hitmonlee is much
better.

<HITMONLEE> - Rating: ***
He has better stats where it counts (Attack and Speed) and learns a bunch of
powerful STAB moves. Just stay away from Special attacks, which will utterly
decimate him.

<HITMONCHAN> - Rating: *
Hitmonchan learns the elemental punches... all coming off a base Special stat
of 35. Ouch. You'll need to teach him stuff like Submission, so there's no
point getting him at all.

Now, if you've done the Pokemon Tower in Lavender (which you certainly should
have by now), the entrance to Silph Co. will not be blocked. It's the large
building more-or-less in the centre of the city. And yes, it's a mandatory
dungeon filled with Rockets and absolutely no wild Pokemon. Oh, and to make it
even more fun, there are teleporter pads! I hate this place. Make sure to
deposit all your items in the PC, because this place is *rammed* with ****

First of all, we're going to get the Card Key, so that we can access all the

combing it for items and trainers before moving up a floor, and then finally
we'll take on our Rival and the boss before we can leave this hideous place.

Note: There is a nurse on 9F who will heal your team like at a Poke Center, if
you need it. From the entrance to 9F, go left, then down, beat the Rocket (he
has a Golbat, Drowzee and Hypno at L28), then use the Card Key (obtained in
just a second from 5F) to head left to find the nurse.

On the first floor, there is nothing. Enter the lift and select '5F'. Head west
and examine the first plant pot you see (the one on the right) for a hidden
<ELIXER>. Ignore the scientist to the west for now, then go south and step into
the teleporter next to the Rocket. Immediately step back on the teleporter and
then engage the Rocket I just mentioned.

That's it for the mooks around here; let's bring on the boss already! Head to
9F, heal up, then make your way to 3F. Head down the middle corridor, then
swing a left and use the teleporter in the room here. Two steps left will land
you in a fight with your Rival, so be ready. By the way, this is my team now:
___

My Team

Golem       L49 ~ Rock Throw, Submission, Earthquake, Explosion
Venusaur    L42 ~ Tackle, Vine Whip, PoisonPowder, Razor Leaf
Alakazam    L46 ~ Psybeam, Recover, Reflect, Psychic
Zapdos      L51 ~ ThunderShock, Drill Peck, Thunder

Nothing new here, just the addition of Zapdos. You'll want something with good
Attack and Special stats to take on the next gym, which is full of Psychics.
*Gulp*. Psychic types don't have much in the way of weaknesses, so you just
have to slam them on their weaker physical side (that's why you need Attack)
while being able to withstand their attacks yourself (that's what the Special's
for). Zapdos fits the bill here.

*If you skipped the Route 22 Rival battle, the game considers the fight lost.

Rival boy is back for yet another round, but if you think I'm going to go into
detail here, you're wrong. Your levels should be faaaaaar above his--especially
Yellow players--or Sabrina, the Psychic master, will absolutely crush you. Just
use type advantages here like you always do. Zapdos also creams everything but
the Electric types.
___

After you win, talk to the Silph employee on the left for a free L15 Lapras!

<LAPRAS> - Rating: **
This adorable Pokemon is obviously far too underlevelled to become a part of
your team, but if you invest the time in it, it can become a behemoth. It is
actually really good, given time.

Take the south teleporter afterwards, then Yellow players will fight Jessie and
James after taking a single step down.

Giovanni shouldn't pose any problems. If he does, you seriously need to level
up before taking on Sabrina, especially if you're a Yellow player. His toughest
Pokemon, Nidoqueen, easily falls to Psychic, Ground, Ice or Water attacks. Tell
me you have at least one of those. He likes to use Guard Spec., which prevents
his Pokemon's stats from being lowered for five turns. Unless you're still
honestly using Growl or Tail Whip, this should just be a waste of a turn for
him.
___

Once Giovanni is defeated, talk to the Silph Co. President for the <MASTER
BALL>, a Ball that has a 100% capture chance against all Pokemon except
trainer-owned Pokemon and the Pokemon Tower Marowak. Rightly, it should be
saved for Mewtwo, the game's most powerful 'Mon, but just as difficult to catch
are Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres, so take your pick. Whoever aggrivates you the
most (I always seem to have trouble with Articuno, for some reason).

There's also a PC you can use to the southeast, if you must. Use the Escape
Rope that we found earlier to get out of here. Finally!
____________

Saffron City
____________

New Items
---------
[ ] TM31 (Mimic)  [ ] Nugget (H)  [ ] TM46 (Psywave)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 46

Now that Team Rocket are gone, there are a few more things to do. First, you
can visit Copycat's house in the northwest of the city. Head upstairs and give
her a Poke Doll (bought in Celadon) for <TM31> (Mimic). Also, in the desk, one
square to the right of her computer, is a hidden <NUGGET>.

Now we can finally take on Sabrina, who resides in Saffron City Gym to the
northeast of the city. If you cannot take out a L43 Alakazam (or in Yellow, a
L50), then do not bother taking her on. If you have Zapdos, he should prove
excellent at defeating the spoon-bending freak-of-nature. Otherwise, anything
with strong physical attacks should be okay. It has Recover and Psychic, so
watch out.

Head into the teleporter. I'm now going to assume that you battle the trainers
in a certain order--that is, by heading into the teleporter opposite to the one
you come out of. e.g. if you come out of the northeast teleporter, head into
the northwest teleporter, battling the room's occupant on the way.

She's the same level as Koga, only Psychic is a LOT more dangerous than Poison.
I know that for a while now you've been fighting poor, underlevelled trainers,
but Sabrina is, in Yellow at least, the toughest trainer so far. Having Zapdos
will help out a lot--its high Special means it can take some punishment and its
decent Attack will punch holes in her frail Psychics.

If you do have Zapdos, you can Drill Peck everything and come out on top. She
likes to use X Defend, but this should make very little difference (it's like
using Defense Curl).

I'm not going to discuss anything that isn't named Alakazam--you should be more
than prepared for her little cronies. 'Zam is, of course, one of the most
dangerous Pokemon in the game (you know this already if, like me, you've been
raising one yourself). Both versions have the same moves, except Red and Blue's
Psybeam is turned into Psychic in Yellow--gulp!--and Yellow's is seven levels
higher. Psywave is a set-amount-of-damage-attack, ranging from 1 HP to 1 less
than 1.5x the user's level, meaning it can do 1 to 63 damage in Red and Blue or
1 to 74 in Yellow. This shouldn't be a problem, since your creatures should be
in at least the low 100s.

Recover is its next attack, restoring half its Max HP. If you're doing more
than that amount of damage in a turn, then it's merely a delaying tactic and
he'll fall to a critical hit soon enough. Reflect halves all damage from
physical attacks, so you should try to use them as soon as you can. Finally, we
have Psybeam or Psychic, a devasting move with lots of power in the hands of
Alakazam. Psychic has a 30% chance each turn of lowering your Special stat
while Psybeam is less powerful but might cause confusion. Needless to say, it
will be in your best interests to finish him off quickly.

The best way to do this is by having a strong physical attacker with a decent
Special stat to soak up attacks. And, of course, make sure they aren't Poison
or Fighting. Golem works in a pinch, but his low Speed and Special mean Psychic
will hammer him before he lets off an Earthquake. Normal types such as Snorlax
will do very well; it can soak up Psychic all day with its gargantuan HP.
Zapdos is probably the best thing you can get at this point--a minimum of L50,
with fantastic stats and a 120 power physical move--it's something you'd dream
for.

If, however, you have none of these, you might have to use two Pokemon--one to
soften him up and another to deliver the killing blow (before he uses Recover).
Finally, the last resort is to fight fire with fire--that is, use your own
Psychic type, who will resist Psychic and isn't affected by Reflect. Of course,
you'll be doing very little damage in return, but if you have the edge stat-
wise, you'll come through eventually.
___

Defeating Sabrina earns you the MarshBadge, which lets you train traded Pokemon
up to level 70 before they start to disobey you. She'll also fork over the
terrible <TM46> (Psywave), that set-amount-of-damage-attack I mentioned before.
Anyway, to get out, take the following teleporters: The one next to Sabrina,
northwest, northwest, northeast, southeast.

Heal up and do whatever you usually do once you've earned another badge
(perhaps a victory jig?), then make your way to Fuchsia City. You're going to
need to prepare yourself now. We're heading to Seafoam Islands where we'll be
bagging ourselves another legendary Pokemon; the icy bird of the legendary
trio--Articuno. If you didn't already guess, Zapdos was the electric bird. And
there's a fire one later too (although it's easily the worst of the three--this
game hands them to you in reverse order of usefulness).

Bring a Surf-user, a Strength-user, an Escape Rope or Dig-user, a bunch of
Ultra Balls (for Arty), a bunch of Great Balls (for the wild Pokemon there) and
a status-inflicting Pokemon. You might also want to consider changing boxes. On
the way, there are a lot of trainers to take care of, so you might also want a
Fly-user to Fly to a Center to restore PP. Take Fuchsia City's south exit on to
the beach.

Yep, Tentacool is to seas what Pidgey is to land and Zubat is to caves. You'll
get very sick of this guy. Anyway, before we can start catching the tasty fish-
I mean, Water Pokemon... you'll need to take out the two trainers below you.
And no, you're not getting any strategies. All the trainers on the route are in
their low 30s, so you'll be fine.

In Yellow only, a building appears on the left, which is the Surfing Pikachu
minigame. You'll need a Pikachu with Surf acquired from the N64 Stadium game
(or acquired via a GameShark) to participate. For more information on this min-
game, check out section A01; 'Pikachu's Beach'. Don't worry if you can't get a
Surfing Pikachu--you're not missing out on much.

Surf on to the water and catch whatever you haven't got yet. Then start heading
south, taking on all the trainers you meet along the way. First, the trainer
just to the south of the beach.

If you keep heading south, staying roughly in the centre of the Route, you'll
come across four trainers arranged so that each one faces either north, west,
south or east. That's the order I'll be defeating them in here:

Up to the northern edge of the Route, you can head west and get yourself on to
dry land. Head west. You'll notice there are two cave entrances. The uppermost
one has a trainer to the southwest of it; you'll have to Surf on to the water
again to face her. After that, it's Articuno time.

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 48

There's a lot of stuff to catch here if you didn't go on a frenzy with your
Super Rod earlier, but the only new thing to all versions is Seel and its
evolution, Dewgong.

<SEEL (Y)> - Rating: **
I would evaluate Seel here, but the best one is a traded one on Cinnabar
Island, so look there for details. Unfortunately that's only for Red and Blue,
so Yellow ones are stuck with a much lower levelled one. It's okay, but a bit
late in the game to be massively useful since you'll have to grind like crazy.
It's just an inferior Lapras, but hey, if it's cute, why not?

Red and Blue players should catch a Slowpoke and evolve it into Slowbro (or
alternatively catch a Slowbro) to trade for a Lickitung in Route 18.

<LICKITUNG> - Rating: *
Well, Lickitung gets boosted experience at least, but it's far from being a
decent fighter. Many better Normal types exist, if you want to try them.

Anyway, head east, then north and use Strength to push the boulder into the
nearby square hole. If you screw up by pushing it into a corner, leave and re-
enter to reset the puzzle. This applies to all rooms, so remember it well.

Follow the boulder down the hole, then push it in a hole again. Repeat this
process until you fall into a heavy current of water, which will push you to a
different section of the dungeon. Head to the southeast and step on to the tiny
patch of land. Face down and hit A for a hidden <ULTRA BALL>.

Surf north and ascend the steps on to a large rocky plateau. Head west and
follow the path to a ladder, which you should climb. Head up the stairs, then
loop around south and take the ladder here. Head east and examine the rocky
square here for a hidden <NUGGET>. Head back down the ladder to the west, the
one you just came from.

Head east, then go south at the intersection and follow the path down some
steps, then head west. Examine another rocky square here for a hidden <MAX
ELIXER>. Ahead of you are four boulders--we need to push two of them down two
different holes. If we label them--from left to right--A, B, C and D, then push
B left until you can push A south into its hole. Then push D all the way up.
Finally, push C one down, two left, then loop around the hole and push C south.
Done. Fall down either hole afterwards.

Surf all the way north. On a lonely plateau here rests the legend of ice,
Articuno. SAVE BEFOREHAND!

Fated Encounter: Articuno                Version: R  B  Y
---------------------------------------------------------
#144: Articuno    ICE / FLY  L50  1535 Exp.
 ~ Peck, Ice Beam
_________________________________________________________

Much the same as Zapdos, there is next to no point in chipping away Articuno's
health, since it will not increase your chances to catch him by very much.
Instead, inflict a status condition on him--SLP and FRZ are the best ones--and
start lobbing Ultra Balls. If you want to know why this is the best strategy,
take a look at capturing Zapdos above, or the Mechanics and Formulae section
for a more in-depth view. Trust me on this.

Peck is harmless, but Ice Beam can freeze your Pokemon. In RBY, that's a Game
Over--Freeze is only curable with items, or getting hit by a Fire attack which
Articuno obviously does not possess. Follow my advice: Slam status on it, chuck
Ultra Balls, reset if you screw up. You'll get him eventually.
___

<ARTICUNO> - Rating: *****
Articuno is simply a fantastic Pokemon with a brilliant stat spread and
brutally powerful STAB moves, and it doesn't need any TMs at all to function
well. I made it an instant team member.

Now, if you heeded my earlier advice, you have an Escaoe Rope or Dig-user on
hand. If you didn't follow my advice, I guess I can find it within myself to
bail you out of this mess.

If, like me, your Pokemon are in bad shape, you'll want to get to a Poke Center
immediately. We could continue west from Seafoam Islands along Route 20, but I
don't fancy coming down Route 19 again, so I'm going to come back to the other
half of Route 20 later on, okay? There are only trainers there, so you're not
missing out on much.

Anyway, to get out of here Escape Rope-free, head south and up the stairs on to
the landmass here. Head up the ladder, loop to the south and climb this ladder.
Now head up the stairs on the landmass to the north, then head to your east and
take the ladder here. Head down the stairs to your southwest, then loop around
north and take the ladder on the tiny plateau here. Finally, head south to exit
the caves.

I don't know about you, but my Pokemon are in terrible shape. Fly to any city
with a Poke Center and take care of yourself, then Fly to Pallet Town, taking a
Surf-user with you. Head to the water to the south of town and hop in, heading
south.

[ ] Tangela (RB)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 48

Surfing down just a tiny bit revelas an open expanse of tall grass on your
right--unfortunately, the only new thing is Tangela for Red and Blue players.
Everything else is very common muck. Anyway, much like Route 19, you just Surf
down and fight every trainer on the way.

Surf down the left hand side of the route to encounter two trainers sitting on
a platform. Take out the northwest one first:

The main atraction of Cinnabar Island is the Missingno. Glitch and the ability
to catch any wild Pokemon available in the previous area (including Safari Zone
Pokemon catchable by normal means--see section C01; 'The Cinnabar Island
Glitch' for details). Legitimately, Cinnabar is still quite fun--check out the
Pokemon Lab; the big building to the left of the Poke Center. Take out your
fossils (Dome/Helix Fossil, Old Amber) and head inside, where there are three
rooms. The first contains two people who want to trade; in Red and Blue, you'll
get Tangela for Venonat and Electrode for Raichu. In Yellow, you'll get Dewgong
for Growlithe and Rhydon for Golduck. Do whatever you wish--but you can get
these Pokemon in the wild with ease.

In the second room, the man in the corner will fork over <TM35> (Metronome) and
in the last room someone wants to trade Seel for your Ponyta (R/B).

<SEEL (RB)> - Rating: ****
Despite average stats and arriving very late, Seel has all the tools it needs
to succeed--being a Water type on a Fire-dominated Island and gaining boosted
EXP. points are massive pluses. It even gets the brilliant Ice Beam naturally!

You can also get Muk for your Kangaskhan (Y). The guy at the top is the one who
will transform your fossils. You'll have either the Dome or Helix Fossil from
Mt. Moon, which turn into a L30 Kabuto or Omanyte respectively. I also
recommended that you pluck the Old Amber from Pewter museum earlier, which
entitles you to a L30 Aerodactyl. Sweet. That's all for this place.

<OMANYTE> - Rating: ***
A useful Water type that's got an awesome Special stat and a resistance to
Normal moves because of its part Rock typing. It's a bit slow and maybe it
arrives too late, but it can be a solid teammate if you want it.

<KABUTO> - Rating: ***
Not quite as powerful since it has to use non-STAB moves to use its higher
Attack stat, but still useful enough. Average Special gives it usable Water
moves too, and it's merely average in terms of Speed as opposed to bad.

<AERODACTYL> - Rating: **
A terrible movepool outside of Fly, but otherwise can abuse its fantastic Speed
and great Attack to decent effect. Not massively good, but usable if you are
persistent.

The gym in the northeast of the city is closed, so you know what this means.
Yep, long dungeon to trawl through to get the right to challenge the Gym
leader. That dungeon is to the west side of the island, in the form of a large
building. Grab some Great Balls to nab the new wild Pokemon and some Super
Repels (best value for money) to keep away the common muck, then enter.

Lots of Fire types here.

<PONYTA (RB)> - Rating: **
<MAGMAR> - Rating: *
Ponyta and Magmar are new additions (well, unless you Yellow players caught a
Ponyta earlier anyway), but Fire types generally have limited use in RBY and
they're underlevelled at this point. Don't bother, but definitely catch a
Ponyta and run it back to trade for the awesome Seel in the Pokemon Lab next
door.

<KOFFING> - Rating: *
Grimer and Koffing also make appearances, but if you only learn one thing from
this guide, make sure it is this: Being weak to Psychic types is just painting
a great, fat target on your head. Poison types should be avoided like the
plague, unless they have a second type that dampens their weakness. Grimer was
encountered earlier by Yellow players in the Power Plant, at least.

Once inside, head north. Examine the fifth pillar on the right for a hidden
<MOON STONE>, then take the northeast passage past the stairs. You can grab an
<ESCAPE ROPE> on the way. Head back to the stairs and ascend them, then ascend
the stairs next to you.

Inside there is a trainer pacing about. He won't engage you--you'll need to
prompt him to battle.

Absolutely grab <TM14> (Blizzard) next to the statue; it's one of the most
powerful moves in the game, with 120 Power and 90% accuracy and a fantastic
type to boot. Very recommended for the Elite Four, but don't teach it to
Articuno, who gets it at L51.

Flip the secret statue switch and head all the way left for a <FULL RESTORE>.
Head back to the stairs, but don't take them--instead, head north along the
east wall to engage a Scientist.

[ ] TM38 (Fire Blast)

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 50

Okay, it's time to take on Blaine, the Island's Gym leader. He uses Fire types,
so bring your Water, Rock and Grounds but leave your Grass and Ice types (I
hope to God you're not using Bug types either). Heal up at the Poke Center,
then enter the Gym on the east side of the Island. You need the Secret Key to
enter, so don't deposit it.

I'll show you my team so far, which should be a fairly decent guideline to what
levels you should be at. I'll probably be a bit higher than most of you, since
I've bagged both Zapdos and Articuno:
___

My Team

Golem       L51 ~ Rock Throw, Submission, Earthquake, Explosion
Venusaur    L51 ~ Tackle, PoisonPowder, Razor Leaf, Growth
Alakazam    L47 ~ Psybeam, Recover, Reflect, Psychic
Zapdos      L53 ~ ThunderShock, Drill Peck, Thunder
Articuno    L50 ~ Peck, Ice Beam

We're getting close to the end of the game now, so it is important to have a
team of L50s now or very soon. Otherwise, the Elite Four will cream you (unless
you're an expert and have specially trained your Pokemon). You will want
something as varied as this, with similar types and perhaps a Water move or a
bulky Normal type in there as well. If I could be bothered to train one, I'd
have a Snorlax with Amnesia, Rest, Body Slam and Surf. But I'm lazy, so I'm
going to nab that L50 Moltres in Victory Road. Probably.

Note that, as always, this team is not supposed to be what I think is the best
team. For a start, Rock Slide would be better than Rock Throw and Thunderbolt
would be a better choice than Thunder. I'm a bit stingy with TMs, you see.
___

This Gym requires you to answer a series of Yes/No questions to proceed. You
examine the console in each room to get the question. By answering it
correctly, that room's trainer can be bypassed, but if you answer incorrectly,
you'll be forced to fight them.

Either way, if you want to fight all the trainers, it doesn't matter how you
answer; if you answer correctly you can still fight the trainer afterwards. If
you answer incorrectly, you fight the trainer, but the door is then opened for
you anyway. So yeah, get started already:

Q1: Caterpie evolves into Butterfree? YES.
Technically it evolves into Metapod, but it does eventually evolve into
Butterfree. I said no, but it turns out the answer is yes.

Blaine likes to use Super Potions, although this should only be a mild
annoyance. Growlithe and Ponyta should pose no threat. Then we have two evolved
forms for Red and Blue and three for Yellow.

Rapidash can be pretty annoying with Fire Spin, but thankfully it doesn't do
too much damage. Put it out of its misery with a swift Surf or Earthquake.
Arcanine is the beast of the group--the highest level and the powerful Fire
Blast that will put a dent in anything that isn't Water, Rock or Fire. Take
Down also hurts non Rock types, so try Golem or a sturdy Water type like
Blastoise. In Yellow, it packs Flamethrower, which hurts, and Reflect, which
halves physical damage against its team for five turns. Take it out ASAP.

The only Pokemon I haven't covered is exclsuive to Yellow; Ninetales is, if you
don't faint it quickly, very irritating. It packs Confuse Ray and Flamethrower,
which in tandem will quickly smack you with damage. Switch around to avoid
confusion and make sure your Water or Rock type is available to sponge up those
Flamethrowers.
___

Once you beat him, you get the VolcanoBadge, which secretly raises the Special
stat of your team members for in-game battles to 1.125x its original amount.
Sweet. You'll also receive <TM38> (Fire Blast), a 120 Power, 85% accurate Fire
type move. It's a great power-over-accuracy alternative to Flamethrower.

Fly to Viridian City. It's nearing the end-game now.

____________________________________________________________

Rhyhorn and Rhydon should be no problem--they've got such low Speed and Special
stats that one Razor Leaf or Surf will annihilate them. Don't worry about Horn
Drill being a one-hit-KO move because it only works when the user moves first.
This ain't gonna happen, since the Rhyhorn family are VERY slow. Dugtrio is a
pain with Sand-Attack and Slash (Earthquake in Yellow), but it's too frail to
last long (use Ice Beam/Blizzard, Razor Leaf and Surf).

Then in Yellow, we have Persian. Its moves are irritaing, but especially so is
Double Team; don't let it pull off too many of these of you'll be there all
day. And then in both versions we have the Nidos. Body Slam and Thrash are the
moves to watch out for in Red and Blue, so take them out quickly with Ice,
Psychic, Water or Ground attacks (you should have at least one of those, if not
all).

In Yellow, you might be tempted to avoid their Earthquakes by using a Flying
type. You'll have to be certain that you can score a very quick one-hit-KO or
you'll get hit with Thunder. My L50 Articuno took them both down in one hit
with Ice Beam, for reference. Otherwise, use a bulky Psychic (Hypno or Alakazam
with Reflect up). Use the same move types I mentioned for Red and Blue and you
should be fine.

Giovanni likes to waste his time using Guard Specs. Treat these as a free turn
to attack.
___

After the battle, Giovanni forks over the EarthBadge, which makes all traded
Pokemon up to and including L100 obey you (any higher--those obtained through a
glitch or hacking--are still disobediant, however). He also hands over <TM27>
(Fissure), a one-hit-KO move with 30% accuracy that only works against slower
opponents. However, like I mentioned back in the Celadon City portion of this
guide, if you use an X Accuracy first, the move is boosted to 99.6% accuracy
(but still only works provided you're faster than the foe).

You can talk to him again afterwards to make him say some stuff and then go
away, but it's not really necessary.

Heal up, prepare yourself, then take the west exit out to Route 22.

*If you skipped the Route 22 Rival battle, the game considers the fight lost.

You're going to need to be in the high 40s in level to succesfully take on your
Rival. Your team should look something like his--that is, good levels, lots of
type versatility and somewhat decent movesets.

However, despite his high levels--potentially higher than yours--he's
controlled by utterly moronic AI which will never switch, even when faced with
a type disadvantage. Therefore, being a few levels shy of his Pokemon won't
hurt much.

First up in Red and Blue are Pidgeot and Rhyhorn, neither of whom will pose
much of a problem--Pidgeot bites Rock, Electric and Ice attacks, while Rhyhorn
fails hardest against Ice and especially Water and Grass moves. Neither Pokemon
possesses any dangerous moves (even Rhyhorn's one-hit-KO Horn Drill won't work
if he moves last in a turn, which he will because he's so slow).

Then we have two of Exeggcute, Growlithe and Gyarados. Smack Exeggcute with
Fire, Ice or Flying; Growlithe with Water, Rock or Ground; and Gyarados with
Electric for instant wins. Then he'll send out Alakazam. This guy has dangerous
moves, so send out your strongest Pokemon and lay down your strongest moves,
then hope for the best (that's all you can do versus Psychics--just don't send
out Poison or Fighting types).

Finally, he'll send out his starter. Each one of them has an amazing STAB move,
so make sure to take them out ASAP, using Fire, Ice, Flying or Psychic for
Venusaur; Rock, Water, Ice or Electric for Charizard; and Grass or Electric for
Blastoise. That's all there is to it.

Yellow players will first square off against Sandslash, who falls to Grass,
Water and Ice attacks (see how useful Ice is?). Then Exeggcute, who falls to
Fire, Ice and Flying. Next, he'll send out two of Magneton, Cloyster and
Growlithe. Magneton's only weakness is Ground, so exploit that. Cloyster falls
to Fighting, Electric, Rock and Grass attacks, although the first two are most
effective since Cloyster has super-effective moves against Rock and Grass
types. Finally, Growlithe is really weak, so Water, Rock or Ground will finish
it off.

Next, he'll send out Kadabra--no problem if you've dealt with Sabrina--and
finally his starter. Vaporeon should be taken care of with Electric or Grass.
Flareon falls to the same attacks as any other Fire type, namely Water, Rock
and Ground. Fianlly, Jolteon can't do much to Ground types, so use one of
those.
___

Your Rival is about 12 levels lower than the toughest trainer you will soon
have to face as the last 'boss' of the game, just to let you know. Head back to
the Poke Center, heal up and then make sure you bring a Surf and Strength user
with you. You might also want to get some Great/Ultra Balls (for the high level
wild Pokemon), an Escape Rope or two, a few potent healing items and a handful
of Super Repels. Yep, it's dungeon crawling time.

Continue west through Route 22 and enter the big building at the end. Head
north and the guard will check that you have the BoulderBadge before allowing
you passage into...

There's not much to do on this Route, except show the guards all your flashy
Badges so they let you proceed. The path is fairly linear, but there are a few
hidden goodies. After getting your RainbowBadge checked, you can fish for some
Pokemon if you want, then continue.

After the SoulBadge check, head north on to the 2x2 island and examine the
northwest patch for a hidden <MAX ETHER>. Continue on until you pass the
MarshBadge checkpoint and hit dry land. Turn east into the grass (nothing new,
but all high levels--don't waste your energy!) and examine the southeast tree
for a hidden <ULTRA BALL>.

After the VolcanoBadge checkpoint, head north until you hit a 2x2 grass patch,
then examine the northernmost rock piece to the left of the grass for a hidden
<FULL RESTORE>. I think that's it for hidden items, so just continue through to
Victory Road, a hellhole full of boulder puzzles, high-level trainers and wild
Pokemon and the legendary Pokemon--Moltres.

- Recommended Party Avg. Level: 51

You've seen all of Victory Road's wild Pokemon before, although not at this
level. The only unique Pokemon is, of course, Moltres. It's near the end of the
dungeon, so I hope you've got some status to slap on it and a bunch of Ultra
Balls. If not, don't worry too much--we can exit the cave at the end, stock up,
then come right back. It'll wait patiently for you to catch it.

As you enter, you'll spot a boulder on your left. Get a Pokemon that knows
Strength to push it all the way over to the right side and on to a strange
circular switch. I won't insult your intelligence by telling you exactly how to
do that, but let's just say that you can exit and re-enter if you foul up.

Climb up the stairs on to the plateau and work your way around the east path.
At the intersection, take a right and head down the stiars, then follow the
path to a boulder. There are two items here that you can get--unfortunately,
gaining access to one will block you from getting the other, so to get both
items you'll have to grab one, then exit and re-enter the cave to reset the
boulder, then get the other. The items are a <RARE CANDY> and <TM43> (Sky
Attack).

Head back to the intersection I mentioned, then battle the trainer on the left.

Use the same strategy as you did for Zapdos and Articuno--inflict him with
Sleep or Freeze, then lob Ultra Balls at him until you win. Remember that
lowering his health barely makes any impact on your chance to catch him--spend
those turns throwing Ultra Balls instead.

<MOLTRES> - Rating: **
Unlike the other two legendary birds who are nothing short of fantastic,
Moltres is actually pretty trashy. This is mostly because there are very few
fights left in the game, and Moltres isn't useful for any of them. Bummer.

Return through the ladder you came up, then head east to loop around and then
up on to the plateau. Battle the trainer.

They were the last trainers of Victory Road. Woo! If you couldn't make it
through without taking a trip to the Poke Center, you'll have some trouble
against the Elite Four. Head east, push the boulder into its hole and drop down
after it, then push it west on to its switch. Head up on to the plateau and go
east, then take the ladder here. Take the next ladder and examine the rock to
the left of the ladder here for a hidden <FULL RESTORE>. Finally, exit east out
on to the north portion of Route 23, then head north and take the first gap in
the statues north to enter the Indigo Plateau. *Gulp*.

Okay, here's how it works for those who have been in a coma for the last
decade. The Elite Four is a series of four consecutive battles, where you are
not allowed to visit a Poke Center in between. You can use items, save your
game and switch your first party member, but that's about it. Once you've
creamed the four trainers, I'll try not to spoil much, but be prepared for a
fifth fight against the game's toughest trainer. Again, you can't visit a Poke
Center in between fights. Oh, and losing against even one means you must fight
them all over again.

You might as well bust out all the healing items you've stocked up on so far,
and then don't be tight about buying some at the Mart over on the left. After
all, you won't be spending your money on much else. For maximum coverage and
power, your team should be composed of the following types with the following
moves: Electric (Thunderbolt or Thunder), Ice (Ice Beam or Blizzard), one of
either Grass (Razor Leaf) or Water (Surf or maybe Hydro Pump), Psychic
(Psychic) and Ground (Earthquake or perhaps Dig). You don't need six members,
but if you do and they're all about L50, then that's just a bonus.
___

My Team

Golem       L55 ~ Rock Throw, Submission, Earthquake, Explosion
Venusaur    L53 ~ Tackle, PoisonPowder, Razor Leaf, Growth
Alakazam    L52 ~ Psybeam, Recover, Reflect, Psychic
Zapdos      L54 ~ ThunderShock, Drill Peck, Thunder
Articuno    L52 ~ Peck, Ice Beam, Blizzard
Moltres     L50 ~ Peck, Fire Spin

Moltres is entirely filler, but it's the highest level I've got besides my main
five. Yeah, I know I'm pretty cheap for using the three legendaries, but
honestly, I've spent a long time on this guide and didn't want to spend further
hours grinding away an alternative Pokemon. Anyway, you'll notice that all the
types I've mentioned above are totally covered, so if you have something like
this you should be fine. For discussions on the best Elite Four team, see
section T02; 'In-Game (Elite Four) Teams'.

Note that this team is nowhere near the 'best' team ever. It's just something I
threw together in a relatively quick time to beat the League with. If I wanted
to improve upon it, I could come up with a much better team, which would look
something like this:

Golem       ~ Rock Slide, Earthquake, Body Slam, Submission/Explosion
Venusaur    ~ Swords Dance, Body Slam/Hyper Beam, Razor Leaf, Sleep Powder
Alakazam    ~ Psychic, Recover, Reflect, Seismic Toss
Zapdos      ~ Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, Drill Peck, Rest/Reflect
Starmie     ~ Surf, Ice Beam/Blizzard, Thunderbolt, Recover
Snorlax     ~ Body Slam, Hyper Beam, Rest, Earthquake

Again, not the best team ever, but certainly much better than the one I'm
using.
___

If you just can't beat the Elite Four and you've followed all my advice, then
I'm afraid you'll just have to grind up some levels. Sorry.

Make sure you save before you head up the staircase at the back. The only way
out once you go in is to beat all five trainers consecutively, or lose half
your money by losing the battle. Unless you're fairly certain you can win,
train some more. If you think you can do it, I'd recommend saving before
confronting each Elite Four member (besides the first, of course) so that if it
doesn't go well you can always restart that battle.

Anyway, enough with the preamble. Let's do this.

_________________________________________________________

Since these are the hardest battles in the game, now might be a good time to
learn about exploiting the game's moronic AI if you didn't read section M01;
'AI Mechanics'. Essentially, trainers that are supposed to be 'smart' (Gym
Leaders, Elite Four, high-level trainers) have an AI that forces them to use
super-effective moves *even when that move does no damage*. For example, Rest
is a Psychic type move and so is 'super-effective' against Fighting types,
despite doing no damage. A Fighting type can come in and deck Dewgong with a
swift Submission and all Dewgong will do is Rest.

In addition, trainers will NEVER attack with moves that are 'not very
effective' unless forced to (e.g. Disabling valid moves, having four not very
effective moves, etc.)

Most of Lorelei's Pokemon are capable of causing a Freeze status, which, in
RBY, means your Pokemon is offically out of action until you use a Full Heal or
Ice Heal on it. Lorelei will also occasionally use a Super Potion, which should
just delay her imminent demise.

I noticed that, with my Venusaur, Dewgong still used the 'super-effective'
Rest. It didn't use Aurora Beam, but that might just be because of luck. So
Grass/Poison types should be fairly safe as well. Thus, use Grass types with
Razor Leaf or an Electric type. Zapdos fits the bill as an Electric type, but
must be wary of its Ice weakness--luckily, its high Special stat should soak up
some of the damage. Dewgong's moves and stats aren't the scariest, so hopefully
you shouldn't be troubled by it.

Cloyster has a monstrous Defense stat, but it's rather slow and has an average
Special stat, so smash it with a swift Special sweeper; the best ones would be,
again, Grass (watch out for Aurora/Ice Beam) and Electric, with a powerful hit
taking it out in one. I OHKO'd with Venusaur's Razor Leaf.

Slowbro is up next and depending on your version he'll have good or poor moves.
In Red and Blue, his only damaging attack is Water Gun, so if you send out
something resistant to Water (Grass, Dragon or Water) you won't get damaged.
Too many Amnesias will make it hard to take down though. In Yellow, it's
equipped with the much better combination of Surf and Psychic, which are deadly
when used with Amnesia. Luckily, I took it out in one hit with Razor Leaf--if
you can take it out in one hit then go ahead; it's too slow to hit first. Grass
and Electric are your best friends once more.

Jynx is likely to be a problem--it critical hit Ice Punched my Moltres for an
OHKO--since it only has Bug, Rock and Fire for weaknesses. Rock types often
have a secondary type with an Ice weakness (Ground, Flying) so Fire is the best
bet. However, Fire types are largely not very useful so if you don't have one
(or it's useless, like my Moltres), you might just have to hit it hard with
your strongest Pokemon and then heal them up after the battle. It might also
use Lovely Kiss, but you should have your Poke Flute for that. Its Defense is
atrocious, however, so hit it with a physical attack like Drill Peck or
something for a decent chunk of damage. I used Zapdos.

Lastly, we have Lapras, a living tank of a Pokemon. With massive HP and
respectable Def and Spc stats, this thing isn't going down easily. Plus, it has
two 120 x 1.5 (STAB) = 180 base power moves in Hydro Pump and Blizzard, and a
30% chance to paralyse you with Body Slam. Its Speed is below average, so I
managed to fire off two Razor Leafs to kill it, while I got hit by Blizzard for
about 2/3rds of Venusaurs health bar. If you're faster and have a strong, STAB,
super-effective attack, you should be okay.
___

If you beat Lorelei, well done. That's a good sign for beating the rest of the
Elite Four--Ice is a fantastic type and beating it IS difficult. Although the
next two Elite Four members are higher-levelled, their type choices aren't as
good, so they should be much easier. Well, I found them easier at least. Heal
up and save if you want, then proceed into the next room to fight the next
trainer--a user of Fighting types.

_________________________________________________________

Consider Bruno a breather after Lorelei. He'll try to boost his Pokemons'
Defenses with X Defend which is a massive waste since we will be using Special
attacks to hit his Pokemon hard on their MUCH weaker defensive side.

Onix is a non-issue--even Water Gun and Vine Whip can take this guy out. His
Special is horrendous, but don't try attacking him physically. He's also not
particularly speedy, so you should have nothing to complain about with either
Onix.

Hitmonchan has a horrendous Special as well, which means that Fire, Ice, and
ThunderPunch all have pathetic power. This means that a swift Psychic will take
care of him very easily. The only remotely scary things are Mega Punch in RBY,
which is moderately powerful, and Double Team in Yellow, which is more
irritaing than deadly. Very easy.

Hitmonlee is marginally more threatening because it has decent Fighting and
Normal attacks running off its high Attack. A swift Psychic will still OHKO it
though; just deal with him quickly (most Psychics are fast anyway) and you'll
have no issues.

Machamp is Bruno's biggest brusier, but even he keels before a well-aimed
Psychic. His strongest attack is Submission, but he won't use it if you send
out a Psychic or Flying type, so feel free to use those. In Red and Blue, that
will limit him to his non-damaging moves and Fissure (which he won't use
against Flying types and is totally ineffective against anything faster than
Machamp) and in Yellow his best move then becomes Karate Chop. With its
critical hit factored in, it has 100 effective base power, which isn't
something to laugh at coming off his massive Attack. Still, you shouldn't worry
about it if you have a decent Psychic or Flying type.
___

Bruno was very easy. You shouldn't be any worse for wear except for your PP for
Psychic being three down. Save and heal up (???) before taking on the next
member of the Elite Four.

_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

Theoretically, Agatha is the Ghost type Master, but in actuality all of her
Pokemon only have the Poison type in common. In fairness, using only Ghost
types would limit her to the Gastly line. Anyway, Agatha hits things off with a
Gengar. RB players will most likely get hit by Confuse Ray or Hypnosis or both.
Switch out for the former or use a Poke Flute immediately for the latter to
avoid Dream Eater (which only works if the foe is asleep). In RB, it also has
Night Shade, which will deal 56HP damage when it hits. This shouldn't be a
massive problem.

To defeat it, use a Psychic type or a Ground type. It has a high Special so
will sponge up some damage from Psychic, but it has Mega Drain to combat Ground
types in Yellow. Dugtrio is fast enough and powerful enough to kill it, but
Golem will have to eat a 4x effective Mega Drain. It's only 40 base power
though, and my Golem survived to fire back a one hit KO with Earthquake.

Golbat's next, but this thing doesn't really have much going for it. Its most
damaging attack is Wing Attack, which has a paltry 35 x 1.5 (STAB) = 52.5 base
power. It's more likely to annoy you with confusion, but if you switch around
and hit it with a fast Psychic (Alakzam), Electric (Zapdos), Ice (Articuno) or
Rock type, then it won't pose any threat.

Haunter is a weak Gengar, so just follow my strategy for Gengar. Only it's
easier this time. Arbok is like Golbat in that it's weak and has no good moves.
It'll annoy with confusion and Wrap... that's about it. The main problem Agatha
poses is with her final Pokemon; a Level 60 Gengar. In Red and Blue, Dream
Eater won't work since it has no Sleep moves. It'll use Confuse Ray, Night
Shade and Toxic. Switch out to rid yourself of confusion and revert Toxic
poison to normal PSN, and deal with Night Shade like you did previously. Ground
and Psychic types are A-OK.

In Yellow, it retains Hypnosis over Toxic and slaps Psychic over Night Shade.
Your own Psychic type will resist Psychic and can hit back super-effectively
with its own Psychic. Hypnosis is cured through Poke Flute and Confuse is cured
by switching or riding it out. Dream Eater should be a non-issue if you have
the Flute. Oh, and Agatha uses Super Potions when her Pokemon are on low
health, but this should barely affect the battle outcome.
___

Agatha was moderately tough, but still not much compared to Lorelei. This next
trainer should change all that--he has high level Dragon Pokemon, which you
probably haven't fought before. Their only effective weakness is Ice, so I hope
you have one. Dragons also resist Grass, Fire, Water and Electric attacks, so
be warned. You'll automatically engage him when you stand in the square below
or to the left of him, so make sure you prepare yourself before you go near
him.

_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

Lance doesn't mess around--he uses Hyper Potion, which restores 200HP to a
Pokemon, when his Pokemon's health is low. If you don't think you can down your
foe in one hit, try using a low power attack and then your finisher to avoid
him using it.

Lead off with an Electric type to counter Gyarados--its only other weakness is
Rock and it'll decimate them with Hydro Pump. So yeah, let loose with
Thunderbolt or, if needs must, Thunder, to fry the leviathan. Dragon Rage does
40HP damage, so no issues there, and it's all he'll use if you have a Dragon
type against him. Otherwise, he might use Hyper Beam, which has 150 base power
but requires a recharge turn if the foe doesn't faint. All of Lance's Pokemon
have this, but Rock types resist it and Ghosts are immune to it. Honestly
though, use an Electric type--Gyarados has a 4x weakness to it so he won't last
long.

The Dragonairs are up next. In Red and Blue they're identical and Hyper Beam is
their most dangerous move. Since it has the Psychic type move Agility, this is
all it'll use if you happen to send out a Poison or Fighting type, so feel free
to abuse this mechanic. In Yellow, however, one is tailored as an Electric
attacker and the other as a Water/Ice attacker. A Ground type can handle the
first and a Water type with an Ice attack can handle the second. All versions
of Dragonair absolutely hate Ice attacks though--they croaked it in one hit
versus my Articuno's Ice Beam.

Aerodactyl is up next, with weaknesses against Ice, Electric, Rock and Water.
You'll have at least one of these I hope, so hit him with whatever. You only
have to avoid Flying and Normal attacks (a Rock type resists both) and it has
low Defenses, so any super-effective move should OHKO it.

Dragonite is Lance's bad boy and it will give you hell if you don't have an Ice
type. If you do, like me, then Ice Beam or Blizzard is more than sufficient to
take him out since he has a 4x weakness to Ice attacks. If you ignored my
repeated advice about getting a good Ice move, then this'll be difficult. You
can exploit his use of Agility in Red and Blue (read Dragonair, above), but
Slam and Hyper Beam are both coming off the game's highest Attack, so be
careful.

In Yellow, the bad boy has Thunder, Blizzard, Fire Blast--the unholy elemental
trinity--and Hyper Beam, the meanest attack under the sun (if it KOs you). This
is nothing to laugh at and Dragonite can hit EVERYTHING at least neutrally with
these attacks, if not super-effectively. Only Alakazam on my team is neutral to
all of them, but Hyper Beam would easily KO him. The best you can hope for here
is a ridiculously powerful Pokemon, lots of item usage and a bit of luck. You
will suffer for not having an Ice type. Out of interest, its only other
weakness is Rock.
___

Do not head through into the next room without preparing first--IF YOU ENTER
THE NEXT ROOM, YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIGHT THE CHAMPION. MAKE SURE TO ORGANISE
YOUR PARTY AND SAVE BEFORE ENTERING. Yeah... unfortunately, somebody has
already beaten the Elite Four just moments ago, and to claim the title of
Champion, you'll have to defeat this newly-crowned trainer. Can you guess who
it is? Hint: they have a very well-balanced team.
