## What do you mean by “type-optimal”?
Consider the following: your opponent uses a Charmander. Charmander has **normal type moves** and **fire type moves**.

As luck would have it, you have in your team an Onix. And that means that this charmander won't just be beaten, but will be *completely destroyed*, because: **all of Charmander's moves, i.e. normal and fire type moves, are not-very-effective against rock**, and Onix is rock/ground. Plus, your Onix has rock throw, which is super effective against Charmander, a fire type! Charmander will fall to a chorus of "it's not very effective" and "it's super effective" messages in your favour.

By “type optimal run of pokemon red”, I mean: **I want to visit this complete destruction on every single opposing pokemon in the entirety of the Pokemon red campaign**. And I want to do it with one team of five pokemon.

## Wait, you want to do that to every pokemon in the game? That sounds impossible...
Yes, you are right; to be honest, it is impossible... *if you are limited to choosing pokemon from red and blue*.

However, as we all know, pokemon rgby has glitches, and you can use one of those glitches (the “menu glitch”) to put any pokemon you like into your team, including ones from the later games. I have built a team of five specific pokemon with specific moves. Two of them are real RGBY pokemon and the other three are from the later games.

## Hax! If you’ve glitched/hacked the game then why would anyone care about this playthrough?
Because the team I’ve settled on is still quite interesting. Can you work out what it is? :) The code in this repo works it out.

As you can imagine, I tried to make a “legal” team. But it is impossible. Actually, **the reasons why it is impossible to do this with a legal team are interesting in themselves**, and I will be talking about that on the stream. In particular, **there are two pokemon for whom it is mathematically impossible to find a matchup like this for** - can you guess which ones?.

I believe that all of this has heightened my appreciation for the gen 1 pokemon games - that’s the main reason you might want to join in. Think of it like a glitch assisted speedrun. Just like a glitch-assisted-speedrunner, I am interested in pushing the game to its limits!

## It sounds like you’ll be using a team that would get creamed in PvP, so it’s hardly “perfect”. Serious pokemon players won’t care about this.
I know, and I respect that position. Pokemon is complex, and I am butchering its rules. I fully acknowledge that **my team, though type-optimal, is not "perfect"**.

There are many interesting ways to play this game. You can aim for speed, aim for number of pokemon caught, aim to maximize items, aim for good PvP, aim to hoard money.

Aiming for “type optimality” is something I am doing for *fun*. I find it fun, some of my friends find it fun, and I thought my weird little “type optimal” team might seem fun to one or two of you. And that’s why I’m streaming it.

## Who are you?
I’m a scientific software developer who used to work in the games industry; [here](https://hamishtodd1.github.io)'s my website.

I like the first two pokemon games a lot, but I’m not an expert on them (at least not any more than your average 90s kid!). I’m particularly ignorant about PvP play.

Having worked in the industry, I do know a bit about game design. I've been published on Kotaku, Rockpapershotgun, Destructoid, and Gamasutra.

I am a biologist. My biological background affects the way I see the pokemon games. It will come up in the stream! There is a bit of an analogy between what I’m doing here and genetics.

## Will this be on youtube?
Yes!

## Your emulation setup looks pretty nice, how did you do that?
Thank you, I spent a while making it pretty :o it uses the XBr filter at 3x resolution (and I’m making sure to avoid upscaling), I’m using the super game boy borders, and I’m using the “full color hack”. I’ve not used the full color hack before but it looks pretty great! I’m keeping the gen 1 portraits though, because nostalgia ;D to show you why I’ve bothered with this, here’s a comparison with how it looks if you don’t take care (bilinear filtering, upscaled 672p->720p, super gameboy color style only):

## I know of a forum/subreddit that might be interested in this...
Ah, it would be great if you could let me know about them!
